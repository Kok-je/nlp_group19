Introduction,"However, how frataxin interacts with the Fe-S cluster biosynthesis components remains unclear as direct one-to-one interactions with each component were reported (IscS [12,22], IscU/Isu1 [6,11,16] or ISD11/Isd11 [14,15])."
Novel Quantitative Trait Loci for Seminal Root Traits in Barley,"In the study by Hickey et al. (2012), spikes were sampled from the field at the point of physiological
robinson et al.: genomic regions influencing root traits in barley 11 of 13
maturity, dried, grain threshed by hand, and stored at −20C to preserve grain dormancy before germination testing."
Introduction,"The drug also reduces catecholamine secretion, thereby reducing stress and leading to a modest (10-20%) reduction in heart rate and blood pressure, which may be particularly beneficial in patients with cardiovascular disease.(7) Unlike midazolam, dexmedetomidine does not affect the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide."
Discussion,"By clustering with lowly aggressive close kin (King 1989a,b; Viblanc et al. 2010; Arnaud, Dobson & Murie 2012), breeding females may decrease the time/energy cost of maintaining territorial boundaries (Festa-Bianchet & Boag 1982; Murie & Harris 1988), which could ultimately lead to increases in net energy income (TA) or higher allocations in somatic or reproductive functions."
Discussion,"Ophthalmic symptoms are rare manifestations of the intracranial arachnoid cyst, and include unilateral exophthalmos, visual field abnormality, decreased visual acuity and isolated palsies of the third, fourth and sixth cranial nerves [1–5]."
Discussion,Recent studies identified Wee1 as a potential molecular target in cancer cells and the selective small molecule Wee1-inhibitor MK-1775 demonstrated promising results in cancer cells with enhanced levels of Wee1 (96-98).
3. Discussion,"These problems combine to make early diagnosis essential and immediate treatment a necessity, even for the youngest patients [17, 18]."
Discussion,"Also, results demonstrated that the molecular weight and G/M ratio were important factors in controlling the antioxidant properties of sodium alginate (Şen 2011)."
1. Introduction,"Recently, the light-induced method, which is based on the changes of surface wettability of certain materials [12], has been developed and provides amore convenient approach for cell harvesting [13]."
Introduction,"Currently, with advances in radiotherapeutic, chemotherapeutic, and surgical techniques, limb-salvage surgery has become an accepted treatment [2–9]."
