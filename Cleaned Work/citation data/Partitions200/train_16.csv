DISCUSSION,"[24,25] However, planar I-131 imaging has traditionally suffered from low resolution, and a paucity of anatomic information along with a long list of physiologic variants makes image interpretation challenging.[26] Therefore, it is assumed that the reason why functioning ETT in TGDR has been underestimated in patients with DTC is mainly due to the poor image quality of an I‐131 scan."

Discussion,"Furthermore, considering that the 12.4 kb 3 enhancer expresses so uniformly in nearly all Ptf1a-expressing regions in the nervous
system, it is surprising that this element expresses very sparsely in the pancreas, and even then it is not active until much later in development (Masui et al., 2008)."
