,"Bentley and Haslam (1998, 1999, 2001) further explained that British postal workers adopted work practices involving AOL-related risk. Their study revealed that adopting risk-related work practices was especially linked to their work organisation, which effectively encouraged them to act less safely; to finish their working day earlier, they took shortcuts across more uneven ground and read addresses on envelopes whilst walking. During interviews, these postal workers stated that they were aware of the risks involved in their work practices, but they perceived them as more acceptable than the timewasting associated with a safer work practice. The present study found that work organisation impacted on the adoption of work practices involving greater risk. In the assembler-welder working situation, part supply problems linked to organisational deficiencies in the logistics sector obliged operators to adopt a work practice involving risk. Indeed, when available, parts could be prepared at the start of chassis assembly. Otherwise, operators had to climb more often onto, or down from, a template to collect parts (climbing down from templates being particularly unsafe). The impact of training received by operators in terms of both safety and ways of performing the required task has also been put forward by Bentley and Haslam (1998) and"
