,", 2012; Bergen et al., 2012) but also for studying children’s pragmatic abilities without implicitly assuming they have mastered challenging linguistic structures (Stiller et al., 2011). In this paper, we extend these results beyond simple reference games to full decision-problems in which the agents reason about language and action together over time. To do this, we use the Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP) to implement agents that are capable of manipulating the multiply-nested belief structures required for implicature calculation. Optimal decision making in Dec-POMDPs is NEXP complete, so we employ the single-agent POMDP approximation of Vogel et al. (2013). We show that agents in the Dec-POMDP reach implicature-rich interpretations simply as a byproduct of the way they reason about each other to maximize joint utility."

Introduction,"While it must be acknowledged that the initial acceptance of e-books is an important step toward realizing the early success of this innovation, empirical evidence shows that the long-term sustainability of an innovation and its ultimate success rest on its continued use, rather than on its first-time use.(13,14) This is because the development of innovations usually involves a significant initial outlay of capital, and a lack of continued use of the innovation could jeopardize the organization’s ability to recoup the investment in the development of the innovation, contributing to corporate failure."

,"br A recent work (Bhuiyan et al., 2004) in the SCNT bovine field demonstrated that transfected ear fibroblasts were less able to develop to the blastocyst stage than their non-transfected counterpart, regardless of passage number (early or late). More likely, discrepancies among results reported up to now are due to differences in vector type, transfection protocols (Bhuiyan et al., 2004), NT methods and donor cell culture conditions (Wells et al., 2003; Miyoshi et al., 2003). Furthermore, the site of gene(s) integration(s), the transgene used and its possible interference in endogenous gene expression could influence results (Hodges and Stice, 2003). Another aspect to consider is donor cell lines and genotypes, since Heyman et al. (2002) found that four different subcultures isolated from a single skin biopsy resulted in significantly different NT blastocyst rates (ranging from 5 to 30%), and Kühholzer et al. (2001) even found different morula and blastocyst rates among clonal colonies obtained from the same donor cell fetus. In our investigation of in vivo developmental capacity after transfer of NT embryos to recipient cows, we did not observe significant differences in initial pregnancy (< day 40 of gestation) rates between transfected and non-transfected donor cells, which was also reported by Zakhartchenko et al. (2001). In contrast, Forsberg et al."

,"They initialize their orthogonal mapping using an adversarial training phase, much like Conneau et al. [2018], and solve the optimization problem with alternating minimization. Our approach differs from theirs: by bootstrapping on the solution of a smaller problem to initialize the mapping, we avoid the need for a neural network initialization that is used in their approach. In addition, our annealing scheme on the entropic regularization leads to smooth convergence, with very little sensitivity to initialization. Concurrently with our work,1 Grave et al. [2018] tackle the problem of unsupervised word embedding alignment with a similar optimization framework as the one proposed by Zhang et al. [2017b], combining Wasserstein distances (an instance of optimal transport distances) and Procrustes alignment. Their approach differs from Zhang et al. [2017b] in how they scale up optimization, by relying on a stochastic Sinkhorn solver [Genevay et al., 2018]. In addition, they initialize their approach by solving a convex relaxation of the the original problem. Although driven by a similar motivation (word embedding alignment) and relying on similar principles (joint optimization of optimal transport coupling and feature mapping) as the work of Zhang et al. [2017b] and Grave et al. [2018], our approach differs from them in several aspects."

DISCUSSION,"[24,25] However, planar I-131 imaging has traditionally suffered from low resolution, and a paucity of anatomic information along with a long list of physiologic variants makes image interpretation challenging.[26] Therefore, it is assumed that the reason why functioning ETT in TGDR has been underestimated in patients with DTC is mainly due to the poor image quality of an I‐131 scan."

,"Identity begins to take shape during adolescence, but, with the incorporation of new life experiences, is continually modified throughout adulthood (McLean, 2008). Theories of identity maintain that individuals engage in particular actions to confirm their own identities and that social role expectations are internalized and demonstrated through behavior (Stryker & Burke, 2000). Most historical models of adult development that are discussed in the literature are based on research with all-male subjects or were written from a male vantage point (Caffarella & Olson, 1993). Factors that most meaningfully impact the identities of older women are unacknowledged in these models (Price, 1998).

,"multiple equilibria, see Albanesi et al. (2003), King and Wolman (2004) and Blake and Kirsanova (2012), and a simple New Keynesian model is not appropriate to investigate many consequences of policy delegation. As there is no particular reason to assume one equilibrium will prevail any more than another, even if the delegation schemes behave locally as intuition might suggest globally could be a different matter. The central questions addressed in this paper follow on from this. How do delegation schemes affect the likelihood of obtaining multiple equilibria in more realistic models? If multiplicity survives, how should we quantify the welfare implications of choosing one of these delegation schemes? Can any of these schemes affect the likelihood that economic agents successfully coordinate on the best equilibrium? To address these questions we study a version of the familiar sticky price model modified to incorporate capital accumulation (Sveen and Weinke, 2005; Woodford, 2005). This model contains all the features as at the heart of many DSGE models used in policy analysis which makes it a ‘representative agent’ for our policy analysis. Moreover, we choose a set up which encompasses the ‘worst case’ scenario: there are expectation traps and economic agents may be more likely to coordinate on the worst equilibrium (Dennis and Kirsanova, 2012). We confirm the previous results that all these delegation schemes can improve social welfare, but we show that they only unequivocally improve welfare if the economy remains in the best equilibrium. At the same time, we demonstrate that none of the considered delegation schemes eliminates expectation traps, moreover, new equilibria arise under delegation. Whether there is a gain associated with a transition to a delegation scheme will depend on which equilibrium under the original unmodified objective one starts from and to which equilibrium one transitions. More encouragingly, all delegation schemes reduce the range of parameters which ensure the unique worst equilibrium, thus increasing the likelihood of coordinating on the Pareto-preferred equilibrium. We also argue that a delegation scheme can change the way how agents coordinate on an equilibrium. In particular, we show that price level targeting increases the likelihood that the best equilibrium realizes. The paper is organized as follows. In the next section we outline the model and discuss the calibration. Section 3 recapitulates the analysis in Blake and Kirsanova (2012) for our sticky-price model with capital, showing how multiplicity arises when monetary policy is conducted under discretion and with an unmodified monetary policy objective."

,"Peña and Brody (2014) demonstrated that both reactions mainly occur when deviant posts are perceived as reflecting negatively on their recipient. These authors further argue that through hiding and unfriending the deviate, recipients of deviant messages strive to distance themselves from the deviate. Thereby, they seek to reduce the negative effects the behavior has on them. Similarly, research on group schisms has shown that identity subversion as an outcome of norm-deviant behavior motivates group members to distance themselves from the behavior by leaving the group (e.g., Sani & Todman, 2002). In their recent literature review, Nicholls and Rice (2017) outline several additional reactions to online deviance."
