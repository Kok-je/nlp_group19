INTRODUCTION,"It has also been shown that rapamycin can prevent chronic mechanical-overload-induced increases in fiber size (i.e. hypertrophy) (Bodine et al., 2001; Goodman et al., 2011a)."
Introduction,"…these traits are strict seasonal breeding, cathemerality (equal activity during both day and night), low basal metabolic rates, a low degree of frugivory (a highly variable food source) for primates of their body size, female dominance, and a lack of sexual dimorphism (reviewed in Wright 1999)."
,"In [5], Sigurjonsson and Kim obtained bounds on the capacity region for two-user MACs with identical causal side information at the transmitters."
Methods,"We used the apparent modulus to estimate apparent bone strength (ultimate stress, MPa) according to previously determined linear relationship between these two outcomes [7]."
4.3. Deceleration of the slow exchanging substrate in the S2→ S3 transition,"This deceleration can be caused by the structural change of the Mn4CaO5 catalyst that occurs upon the S2 → S3 transition and/or by the additional oxidation of the OEC [13,52,53]."
,"Importantly, the results of Pascalis et al. (2005) also revealed that the now 9- month-olds (i.e., those infants who received additional exposure to the monkey faces) still showed reliable discrimination of monkey faces whereas a second group of 9-month-olds who did not receive the 3 months of…"
DISCUSSION,"As suggested by Nguena et al, there is a need to educate health professionals in remote areas and to develop a simple‐to‐follow algorithm to aid in the accurate diagnosis of OSSN.[8] The use of smart phone applications that are available in ophthalmology to transmit images from the field to the referral centers would be another way to improve early diagnosis of OSSN."
DISCUSSION,"Skeletal muscle is also a primary site of disease in mouse models of ALS (Dobrowolny et al., 2008; Wong and Martin, 2010; Luo et al., 2013) and possibly in human ALS (Vielhaber et al., 2000)."
,"ACTIVATION OF TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS Roles for several transcription factors have been demonstrated in TLR activation, including AP-1-binding proteins (such as cjun and c-fos) and NF-κB (Akira, 2009; Kawai and Akira, 2010) and some of these have been implicated in TLR signaling in the mast cell."
Introduction,Most studies focused on the relation between brain activation and motor function (Guzzetta et al. 2007; Staudt et al. 2002) or the effects of intervention on brain activation (Golomb et al. 2010; Sutcliffe et al. 2009; Walther et al. 2009; You et al. 2005; Cope et al. 2010).
