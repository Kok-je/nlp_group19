,"br A recent work (Bhuiyan et al., 2004) in the SCNT bovine field demonstrated that transfected ear fibroblasts were less able to develop to the blastocyst stage than their non-transfected counterpart, regardless of passage number (early or late). More likely, discrepancies among results reported up to now are due to differences in vector type, transfection protocols (Bhuiyan et al., 2004), NT methods and donor cell culture conditions (Wells et al., 2003; Miyoshi et al., 2003). Furthermore, the site of gene(s) integration(s), the transgene used and its possible interference in endogenous gene expression could influence results (Hodges and Stice, 2003). Another aspect to consider is donor cell lines and genotypes, since Heyman et al. (2002) found that four different subcultures isolated from a single skin biopsy resulted in significantly different NT blastocyst rates (ranging from 5 to 30%), and Kühholzer et al."

Discussion,"Language difficulties are often considered as secondary effects of a broader condition, but our results suggest that haploinsufficiency of genes in the BP3-BP5 region can influence language ability directly, reinforcing the view that recurrent CNVs relevant for neurodevelopmental phenotypes tend to be incompletely penetrant and associated with a variable phenotype [45]."

Discussion,"No gender differences were found in the studies by Ugar and Semb (2001), Giannakari (2004), Rajion et al. (2006), and Lima et al. (2009)."
,"Since no such differences could be detected in the expression of the endogenous ctl(VI) gene by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry (Marvulli et al., 1996), it should be concluded that the 7."
,"br A recent work (Bhuiyan et al., 2004) in the SCNT bovine field demonstrated that transfected ear fibroblasts were less able to develop to the blastocyst stage than their non-transfected counterpart, regardless of passage number (early or late). More likely, discrepancies among results reported up to now are due to differences in vector type, transfection protocols (Bhuiyan et al., 2004), NT methods and donor cell culture conditions (Wells et al., 2003; Miyoshi et al., 2003). Furthermore, the site of gene(s) integration(s), the transgene used and its possible interference in endogenous gene expression could influence results (Hodges and Stice, 2003). Another aspect to consider is donor cell lines and genotypes, since Heyman et al. (2002) found that four different subcultures isolated from a single skin biopsy resulted in significantly different NT blastocyst rates (ranging from 5 to 30%), and Kühholzer et al. (2001) even found different morula and blastocyst rates among clonal colonies obtained from the same donor cell fetus. In our investigation of in vivo developmental capacity after transfer of NT embryos to recipient cows, we did not observe significant differences in initial pregnancy (< day 40 of gestation) rates between transfected and non-transfected donor cells, which was also reported by Zakhartchenko et al. (2001). In contrast, Forsberg et al. (2002) reported lower rates of initial pregnancy for NT of transfected cells than for NT of non-transfected cells."

5.2 Stability of the selection trait,"Consequently, on the basis of these findings, the difference in thigmotaxis between the selectively bred HOFT and LOFT mice seemed to be a stable and robust feature of these animals, suggesting that the two lines differed with regard to trait anxiety rather than to state anxiety (see Belzung & Griebel, 2001; Lister, 1990)."

,"Whereas Lorden used crude upper bounds for the Type I error probability that are too conservative for practical applications, Bartroff and Lai (2008) overcome this difficulty by developing numerical methods to compute the Type I error probability and also extended the three-stage test to multiparameter and multi-armed settings, thus greatly broadening the scope of these efficient adaptive designs. A review of their method is given in Section 2.1. In Section 4 we prove the asymptotic optimality of these adaptive tests in the multiparameter case, extending Lorden’s (1983) result for the special case d = 1. Another new addition to this asymptotic optimality theory of adaptive designs is related to the problem of trial extension considered in Section 2.2. As pointed out by Cui et al. (1999), the issue of increasing the maximum sample size sometimes arises after interim analysis in group sequential trials."

,"3 Perceived reachability Perceived reachability (PR) is a relatively new concept in IS/IT research, but has been used with research dealing with wireless technology, for example by Kim and Garrison (2009), who were among the first to incorporate PR into the TAM framework. PR refers to “an individual’s perception regarding the degree to which he or she can “reach” other individuals “anytime-and-anywhere” via mobile wireless technology” (Kim and Garrison, 2009, p. 326). Thus, PR refers to the capability to connect with others. Sales jobs can necessitate spending a considerable amount of work time away from the employer’s base, and it can be argued that mobile technology provides an ideal enhancement for salespeople. Indeed real time responses to customers improve the working processes of salespeople (Sheng et al., 2005). Moreover, Rivers and Dart (1999) suggested that timely information could improve the quality of any sales effort."

,"br A recent work (Bhuiyan et al., 2004) in the SCNT bovine field demonstrated that transfected ear fibroblasts were less able to develop to the blastocyst stage than their non-transfected counterpart, regardless of passage number (early or late). More likely, discrepancies among results reported up to now are due to differences in vector type, transfection protocols (Bhuiyan et al., 2004), NT methods and donor cell culture conditions (Wells et al., 2003; Miyoshi et al., 2003). Furthermore, the site of gene(s) integration(s), the transgene used and its possible interference in endogenous gene expression could influence results (Hodges and Stice, 2003). Another aspect to consider is donor cell lines and genotypes, since Heyman et al. (2002) found that four different subcultures isolated from a single skin biopsy resulted in significantly different NT blastocyst rates (ranging from 5 to 30%), and Kühholzer et al. (2001) even found different morula and blastocyst rates among clonal colonies obtained from the same donor cell fetus."

EC increases gradually with increasing field moisture and plateaus when field moisture reaches maximum soil water capacity (Dalton 1995; Dietrich et al. 2013). The current research supports these previous results, as the EC increased and EI decreased following irrigation, regardless of treatments (Table 2). Dalton (1995) explained that a decrease in EC was caused by less effective root tissue in contact with soil medium."

Discussion,"Ultimately, compensatory mechanisms secondary to altered cholinergic signaling might lead to reduced mGluR levels and consequently alters synaptic learning rules and attention behavior (Counotte et al., 2011a, b; Goriounova and Mansvelder, 2012b)."

,"Another potentially important link between oxidative stress and excitotoxicity is the microglial antiporter system Xc 2 (Sato et al., 2002), which releases cytotoxic levels of glutamate into the interstitial compartment to replenish intracellular cystine to maintain the glutathione system, which is challenged by oxidative stress (Qin et al."
3. Results,"The interventions were implemented in various settings including academic medical centers [3, 11, 13, 44, 50, 56, 65], five of which were multiinstitution collaboratives [11, 13, 44, 56, 65], universities [14, 60, 62], medical clinics [16, 61, 69], and community-based locales [15, 67]."

Discussion,"These results are in accordance with previous reports demonstrating that olanzapine treatment did not modify the meal size (Chintoh et al. 2008; Weston-Green et al. 2011; WestonGreen et al. 2012), but may reduce the inter-meal period thereby causes hyperphagia (Lee and Clifton 2002)."
RESULTS,"7C) that may correspond to the centrosomal katanin previously observed after nocodazole-mediated disruption of the spindle pole (McNally and Thomas, 1998)."
4. Discussion,"In this study no association emerged between smoking, menstrual characteristics, contraceptive methods (oral contraceptive and IUD use) and frequency of adenomyosis, this is consistent with the scanty published data [7]."
