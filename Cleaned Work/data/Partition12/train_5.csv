,"Identity begins to take shape during adolescence, but, with the incorporation of new life experiences, is continually modified throughout adulthood (McLean, 2008). Theories of identity maintain that individuals engage in particular actions to confirm their own identities and that social role expectations are internalized and demonstrated through behavior (Stryker & Burke, 2000).

,"multiple equilibria, see Albanesi et al. (2003), King and Wolman (2004) and Blake and Kirsanova (2012), and a simple New Keynesian model is not appropriate to investigate many consequences of policy delegation. As there is no particular reason to assume one equilibrium will prevail any more than another, even if the delegation schemes behave locally as intuition might suggest globally could be a different matter. The central questions addressed in this paper follow on from this. How do delegation schemes affect the likelihood of obtaining multiple equilibria in more realistic models? If multiplicity survives, how should we quantify the welfare implications of choosing one of these delegation schemes? Can any of these schemes affect the likelihood that economic agents successfully coordinate on the best equilibrium? To address these questions we study a version of the familiar sticky price model modified to incorporate capital accumulation (Sveen and Weinke, 2005; Woodford, 2005). This model contains all the features as at the heart of many DSGE models used in policy analysis which makes it a ‘representative agent’ for our policy analysis. Moreover, we choose a set up which encompasses the ‘worst case’ scenario: there are expectation traps and economic agents may be more likely to coordinate on the worst equilibrium (Dennis and Kirsanova, 2012). We confirm the previous results that all these delegation schemes can improve social welfare, but we show that they only unequivocally improve welfare if the economy remains in the best equilibrium. At the same time, we demonstrate that none of the considered delegation schemes eliminates expectation traps, moreover, new equilibria arise under delegation. Whether there is a gain associated with a transition to a delegation scheme will depend on which equilibrium under the original unmodified objective one starts from and to which equilibrium one transitions. More encouragingly, all delegation schemes reduce the range of parameters which ensure the unique worst equilibrium, thus increasing the likelihood of coordinating on the Pareto-preferred equilibrium. We also argue that a delegation scheme can change the way how agents coordinate on an equilibrium. In particular, we show that price level targeting increases the likelihood that the best equilibrium realizes. The paper is organized as follows. In the next section we outline the model and discuss the calibration. Section 3 recapitulates the analysis in Blake and Kirsanova (2012) for our sticky-price model with capital, showing how multiplicity arises when monetary policy is conducted under discretion and with an unmodified monetary policy objective."

Methods,A similar protocol has been adopted by several previous studies (e.g. Almasi et al. (2010) who restrained barn owl nestlings for 26 ± 6 (SD) min; Liebl and Martin (2012) who restrained the birds for 30 min).
METHODS,"In 38 patients, SPECT was performed using the previously described rest thallium-201/stress technetium-99m sestamibi dual isotope protocol (27,28)."
,"In idiopathic BOOP, histological examinations generally reveal no microorganisms.(2,17,72)"
Discussion,"The action on CNS development of some of the factors contained within E-CSF has been analysed, including the role of the proteoglycans, FGF2, RBP/all-trans retinol system, and the apolipoprotein-carried lipids (Alonso et al., 1999,1998; Martin et al., 2006; Parada et al., 2008, in press)."
Discussion,"The results of the current study indicating a significant correlation between attachment and suicide attempt status are consistent with previous research that has also found a relationship between both anxious attachment (34, 35), avoidant attachment (21), and suicide attempt."
1. Introduction,"Direct table lookup, polynomial approximations, rational approximations [9,10] and table-based methods [11–16], are only suitable for limited-precision operations because their area and delay increase exponentially as the input operand size increases."
2.2 Behavior and Mission of Autonomous System,"In (Rüdiger et al., 2007a) the behavior set of the system was defined as:
Definition 4."
Q Protein of Phage λ,"What NusA contributes was revealed by nuclease probing of RNA emerging from the 82Q-modified complex: If NusA is present, the usual RNA emergence at about 14 nucleotides from the growing end is extended to about 25 nucleotides, implying that NusA and 82Q construct a barrier where the hairpin of an intrinsic terminator forms (126)."
INTRODUCTION,"In this case the membrane of the virus fuses with the plasma membrane and the nucleocapsid is introduced into the cytoplasm (White et al., 1980)."
Methods,"In selecting REM epochs, we took into account the presence of a clearly defined alpha burst in any EEG derivation, the total absence of spindle activity in frontoparietal regions (Jobert et al. 1992), the appearance of rapid eye movements one minute before, and on continuing in REM stage, one minute after the selected epoch."
5. METHOD,"LSTMs are able to capture past signal behavior and they have shown success in many audio processing applications, such as speech recognition and computational paralinguistics [6, 16]."
METHODS,"CTL activity was measured in a standard 4 h 51Cr-release assay, as described previously (Kammer et al., 1999; Moradpour et al., 2001; Gremion et al., 2004)."
RESULTS,"GST-53BP2(715-1005) and GST-GL(1-257) also bind DIG-PP1g1 well, whereas GST-GL(94-257), which does not contain its PP1-binding site, is unable to bind to DIG-PP1g1."
Methods,"2011), by both Neighbor-joining method (Saitou and Nei 1987) and Minimum Evolution method with the parameters (p-distance and completed deletion)."
Discussion,"series [14], although mearsuring signal intensity directly on two different MR equipments, they also gained excellent agreement."
2. N-MEANDER SCANNING TRACE,"Thus, meandering requires 5-20% less bandwidth, as shown in [3] and we consider it as a reference scanning trace within this work."
INTRODUCTION,", 1984a,b; Laughon and Scott, 1984), a peptide motif conferring sequence-specific DNA binding ability to the homeoproteins (Laughon and Scott, 1984; Desplan et al., 1985; Beachy et al., 1988; Müller et al., 1988; Ekker et al., 1991)."
,", 1996) and osteoblasts (Kozawa et al., 1997) in addition to 3T3 fibroblasts (Wu et al."
,"To reflect the social characteristics of users, we adopt the Indian Buffet Model proposed in [9], the author has already proved the model perfectly fits the real data in the simulation."
Discussion,"It is also in agreement with those of Stansley et al. (1997) who obtained high mortality in R. palustris tadpoles, exposed from the egg stage for 10 days to a total mean lead concentration of 1.670 and 0.944 mg Pb/l."
METHODS,"The right leg was fastened to a dynamometer (I-KON, Chattanooga Group, Oxfordshire, UK) at a knee angle of 50¬∞, while the other leg rested in an extended position, as previously described (11, 14)."
Methods,"Study design and data sources
 This was a retrospective study using data from the Israel National Trauma Registry (ITR) database."
3. Methods,"As illustrated in Figure 1(a, b), it transforms CNNs such as VGG [38] and C3D [43] with fc layers at the end of the convolutional networks, meanwhile it also converts CNNs such as ResNet [20] and DenseNet [22] with conv and global average pooling layers at the end, as depicted in Figure 1(c, d)."
3. Methodology,"Following the state-of-the-art technique for exploratory data analysis (Baroni et al., 2014), we decided to opt for unsupervised clustering. The chosen normalized spectral clustering algorithm proposed by Ng et al. (2001) has been effectively applied to various lexical acquisition tasks (e.g. Shutova et al. (2016); Xu & Ke (2016); Sun & Korhonen (2009))."
,The author in [9] utilizes the IBP to describe the users social influence and the circumstances that users select and require the contents just like of which they choosing the dishes at a buffet in the restaurant.
5 Numerical Experiments,"In what follows, we report the percentage of the trials which led to the putative global minimum as given in [19]2."
Discussion,"Assuming that, as mammalian frataxin, CyaY preferentially interacts with the preformed IscU/IscS complex, the addition of frataxin in reconstitution experiments would lead to uncompetitive inhibition, thus explaining the reported inhibitory effect of CyaY on Fe-S cluster formation in vitro [22]."
Introduction,"…for their sex appeal and physical attractiveness; ‘butch queen vogue’, a category that uses elements of vogue of hands, spins and dips; ‘femme queen’, and ‘virgin runway’, a category that is open to participants who are relatively new to the Ball scene (Dickson-Gomez et al., 2014; Galindo, 2013)."
,"1 3 signal intensity of the fluid within the postoperative cavity on FLAIR may monitor tumor progression and predict PFS [13, 14, 16]."
Introduction,"Two studies comprehensively analyzed all available full-length HBV genomes in GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ and reported the frequent occurrence of recombination event between two or more HBV strains [14,15]."
RESULTS,"In caveolae membranes isolated from total plasma membranes using the methods of OptiPrep gradient centrifugation (35, 40) (Fig."
Discussion,"There is evidence that Ang-2 acts as a chemoattractant for regulating monocyte/macrophage infiltration [5, 23], suggesting that treatment with r-Ang-2 may increase macrophage recruitment to remodelling collateral arterioles."
Results,"jejuni 81-176, a virulent strain able to produce gastroenteritis in human volunteers and promote commensal colonization of the chick gastrointestinal tract (Black et al., 1988; Hendrixson and DiRita, 2004)."
2 Methods,"Spectra for water and the O2 dimer are not included in the DOAS fit as previous retrievals found15 their inclusion unnecessary (Boersma et al., 2007; Bucsela et al., 2006)."
3 Experiments,"Embedding are 300- dimensional, the size of all hidden layers is 100 and for training we use ADADELTA (Zeiler, 2012) with a batch size of 20."
