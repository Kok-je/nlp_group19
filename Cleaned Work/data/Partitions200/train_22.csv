Variables OR p Value,"In another report, the authors found that a reduction in DV risk was associated with secondary education for the woman and her partner; there was less consistent evidence of a protective effect of primary education.22
Women who reported DV were likely to report that their spouses had completed at least primary or secondary education (p<0.0001); however, we did not find a significant association between spousal income and DV. Previous analyses of community samples have shown that that low socioeconomic status24 25 26 and low educational status were significant predictors of DV.4 24 26 27 In addition, other studies have found that indicators of household economic prosperity and education of the male partner were inversely associated with the risk of DV.28 29
Findings from a community and clinical study indicated that among the demographic factors that were determinants of DV, the more children a woman had, the less likely was she to be beaten by her partner.28 30 On the contrary, our analyses showed that abused women were more likely to have more children than their non-abused peers."
