Method,"Interestingly, this meta-perceptual distinction between being (perceived to be) dehumanized and disliked parallels a similar distinction between dehumanizing and disliking, which have been shown to exert independent effects on intergroup outcomes (e.g., Andrighetto et al., 2014; Kteily et al., 2015)."

6 Experiments,"We elected to take this course because formal methods for analyzing the efficiency of move ordering strategies in the alpha-beta search are unreported in the literature [27, 30], and as a result, practical experimentation is the accepted form of analysis in the state-of-the-art [26]."

4. Discussion,"Cattle and sheep are thought to be the major reservoir of STEC, since the species often carry STEC in their intestinal flora and serve as a source of food contamination (Martins da Costa et al., 2011). There are some studies about the presence and prevalence of STEC and EPEC in healthy poultry feces and product. The results of the present study revealed the presence of two stx2 positive isolates, which were considered as STEC pathotype. On the other hand, 11% of the examined external and visceral cavity isolates were only positive for the eae gene, which were considered as EPEC strains. Moreover, one of the isolates possessed both stx2 and eae genes which is considered as highly pathogenic. This isolate belonged to phylo-groupD and phylo-subgroupD2. Salehi (2012) in Iranhas evaluated the presence of virulence factors in 290 fecal E."

(1999) and the rested values in the present study revealed similar effects of pre- load and added load on peak trunk flexion and extensor moments.

Also, the peak muscle activity of the TES was about 10 %MVC lower and the IO and EO had larger EMG amplitudes during the pre-trial and trial in the Krajcarski et al. (1999) study."
