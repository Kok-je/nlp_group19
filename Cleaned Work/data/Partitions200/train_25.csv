Additionally, most of the studies were only limited in one single city or air pollutant. For example, based on dailymean concentrations of PM10, NO2 and SO2 for five fixed-site air monitoring stations in urban area of Guangzhou from 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2011, Li et al. (2014) analyzed timescale-dependent relationships between air pollution index (API) and a variety of meteorological factors by the wavelet analysis, and found temperature, RH (relative humidity), precipitation and wind speed were negatively correlated with API."
