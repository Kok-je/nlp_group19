,"The term lesser known species does not imply that the species are unknown, but rather they presently constitute the bulk of wood that finds no economic use (Barany et al. 2003). Hansom (1983) and ITTO (2007) described lesser-known species as those species for which current commercial demand is below their forest production potentials. Freezaillah (1984) also defined an LKS as a commercially less accepted species left in the forest after a logging operation. In this context, LKS have also been called secondary species, unpopular species, non-obligatory species and weed species. More efficient species utilization of LKS requires information on their technical, physical andchemical properties, as well as availability and abundance. This information is very important in maintaining the sustainability of tropical ecosystems, especially species diversity. According to Freezaillah (1984), about 93% of tropical forest volume consists of LKS, many of which are presently being burnt or otherwise wasted through logging operations, agricultural conversion (including shifting cultivation), hydroelectricity projects and conversion into plantations."
Method,"145) and is particularly useful for studying social phenomena about which little is known (Beck, 2004; Wuest, 2007). Because the goal of grounded theory is to generate a formal substantive theory that accounts for a main concern and pattern of behavior that is relevant to those involved (Glaser, 1978), it was a logical approach to examining what men find most challenging about responding to experiences of WPB and how they went about addressing these challenges, an area about which little is known. The focus on contextual influences that is characteristic of grounded theory allowed us to explore and understand factors that accounted for variation in how men responded to bullying such as gender. Even though our approach to grounded theory is rooted in the original strategies outlined by Glaser and Strauss (1967) and subsequent writings by Glaser (1978, 1992, 1998), we believe that knowledge gained from research is shaped by both the researcher and participants and thus is socially constructed (Charmaz, 2003)."

DISCUSSION,"(1995) found a mosaic pattern of staining of neurons, including Purkinje cells, from a MERRF patient who exhibited a moderate proportion of mutant DNA in brain (55% in brain total DNA and 59% in brain mitochondrial DNA; Lombes et al., 1992) when they used antisera directed against cytochrome c oxidase subunit II. The data that we have obtained in the present work on the Purkinje cell pairs would suggest that, among those cells, the level of mutant mtDNA varied very little from cell to cell. Thus, the mosaic phenotype observed by Sparaco et al. (1995) may have arisen from a failure of the residual wild-type DNA to complement the mutant DNA in some cells because of an unfavorable segregation of the two genotypes within the cells."

DISCUSSION,"Eicosanoids derived from AA, including PGE2, TBX2, and LTB4, are more proinflammatory than those derived from DHA (Calder, 2006). The results of our study confirmed this pathway of eicosanoid formation. Chickens fed LR diets had significantly lower levels of PGE2 and TBX2 in the blood than those fed HR diets. These results are in agreement with those of Cherian et al. (2009), who showed that the level of incorporation of n-3 FA was higher, but that of AA in cardiac ventricle lipids was lower, and the levels of PGE2 and TBX2 in the blood of progeny (7-, 14-, 28- and 42-day-old chickens) were lower after feeding HR diets to broiler hens. Liu et al. (2014) reported significantly lower levels of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids (PGE2 and TBX2) in the plasma due to inhibition of phospholipase A2 activity in chickens fed diets rich in PUFA n-3 than in chickens fed diets rich in PUFA n-6."
