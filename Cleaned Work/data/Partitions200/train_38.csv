,"In addition to the trophies and prizes, HBC members gain ‘ball status’ by moving up the ball status hierarchy, comprised of Statement, Star, Legend, and, ultimately Icon statuses, which are based on the number of years in the community, number of awards or trophies amassed, recognition within a particular category, and the number of balls participated in through the years (Galindo, 2013; personal communication with POSSE CAB). Competition can also be heightened through the use of ‘shade’ – backhanded remarks offered by judges or other ball participants (Galindo, 2013). In addition to the formal HBC, there is an emergent ‘Kiki’ or family scene that parallels the House structure but does not maintain the formal relationships that are maintained within the Houses. For example, the families can be formed without a particular House parent and the names are not linked to designers or House founders (i.e. Mafia, Foxx, Golden, Kardashian) (Alonzo Gibson, personal communication 8/14/2015). The family scene emerged as an attempt to reject the perceived rigidity of the Ball scene for up and coming participants. In particular, families formed as an opportunity to provide a safe space where youth could practice ‘vogueing’ and other ball competition skills without experiencing the shade or ‘chopping’ (being cut from the category by judges) that occurs during the competitions. Family scene members may move into the Houses as they get more skilled but they may also remain independent of the Houses and still participate in the balls. This new scene provides new opportunities for youth to become involved in the Ball scene without necessarily belonging to a particular House. The HBC thrives, in part, by serving as an in-group for youth who are so frequently excluded from acceptance within more dominant groups (Rowan et al., 2013). Additionally, the HBC provides both the much-needed acceptance and support that they lack in other contexts, and a safe outlet for expression, camaraderie, and fun. Therefore, although the HBC is a socially constructed space, it is one of few spaces in which Black GBT youth are able to fully embody their multiple identities in a safe space. For example, Kubicek, McNeeley, Holloway, Weiss, and Kipke (2013) observed the acceptance of gender and sexual fluidity of many of the House members and Ball participants."

Canivez and Watkins contended that the Wechsler (2008b) endorsed index scores should probably be considered of questionable clinical utility in applied settings, which is a contention reiterated here."
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION,"These data, in agreement with our earlier work (33), support the hypothesis that the antitumor activity is related specifically to a-CbT and not to some unknown substances present with the purified natural toxin, and reinforced our prior results showing that a-CbT did not cause any cell death among A549-si-mRNA (a7-nAChR) cells (33), sustaining the postulation that its antitumoral activity passes through a7-nAChR inhibition."
