INTRODUCTION,"2005) without reservation and none of the features invoked by Jaeger et al. (1999) have been reassessed or challenged in detail, with the exception of the character analysis by Gunnell and Miller (2001). This defining list of traits overlaps considerably the battery of features long used to support the adapid-anthropoid hypothesis and now regarded as likely convergences (e.g., Rosenberger et al. 1985). Kay et al. (2004) also added to the basic argument of Jaeger et al.
