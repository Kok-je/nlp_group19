,"1998), to provide great £exibility in testing evolutionary hypotheses (Huelsenbeck & Rannala 1997), and simply to give excellent results in the inference of evolutionary relationships (Kuhner & Felsenstein 1994; Huelsenbeck 1995). Constraints imposed by computational complexity are becoming less restrictive as computers improve. Given the recognition of phylogenetic inference as being inherently statistical in nature, it is surprising that so little attention has been paid to experimental design. A number of topics of relevance to experimental design in phylogenetics have been discussed previously. There is something of a folklore surrounding the choice of genes or other genomic regions for investigating particular evolutionary questions, but almost no published quantitative results. It is widely accepted that sequences that have undergone very little evolutionary change since their divergence from a common ancestor, through low substitution rates or short evolutionary times, will exhibit too few di¡erences to contain useful evolutionary information. Equally, sequences that have undergone very large amounts of change (high rates or long times) become `saturated' with changes and no evolutionary signal is detectable amid the noise. Consequently, a happy medium is expected at some intermediate level of sequence divergence, but the àsymptotic' results (for extreme high and low levels of divergence) give no clue as to where this lies. Although there is considerable experience with particular genes and organisms (see Hillis et al. (1996, pp. 336^339) for an extensive list of studies), where comparisons among genes have been made they tend to be evaluated empirically by the congruence of the results obtained among themselves and with researchers'a priori expectations. In addition, a large laboratory e¡ort is needed before even these qualitative conclusions can be reached. The methods introduced in this paper can quantify the e¡ects of varying levels of divergence. They con¢rm the belief that intermediate levels of sequence divergence are most useful, and are able to give estimates of optimal levels of divergence. The necessary analyses can be done before any data are collected. The only other method for assessing which genomic regions are likely to be most useful in phylogenetic questions is that of Yang (1998). This uses simulation to estimate probabilities of successful tree-topology inference. The approach may be extremely time-consuming for realistic problems. The choice of taxa to include in phylogenetic studies has also rarely been discussed. Li et al. (1987) considered the e¡ects of adding outgroup taxa, and Ritland & Clegg (1990) and Maddison et al.",a1f8b013b71d089af43911a37d22260e889e82c4>e0cbb949d062a1134c4d98924f51312090e76514_0,method,"The citation describes a methodology, experimental setup, or algorithm used in the study."

,"(2010). They collected verbal estimates and free-hand measures of outdoor hills using the present device for a set of campus paths ranging from nearly flat (0.5°) to fairly steep (8.6°). Note that the perceived orientation of any specific outdoor hill may depend on a variety of factors in addition to its physical slant (e.g., curvature and viewing distance), but if the free-hand measure represents the NSE orientation, then we should expect the relationship between verbal estimates and free hand (NSE) estimates to remain similar to that observed for near surfaces. In other words, we should be able to make a prediction about the verbal estimates based on the free-hand estimates. ----- Figure 7 to be inserted here ----Figure 7 shows Stigliani et al.’s (2010) numeric estimation data for outdoor slopes plotted against the corresponding free-hand estimates (NSE) for each physical path (physical path inclination is shown next to each data point).",d2453e86d9eb0c2961d97753acd2c8462b22e1ce>9b0628d503edf994bdfd285d283c63df1222ceef_0,background,"The citation does not explicitly describe methods or results, likely providing general context."

,"For example, Kawato et al. (1990) suggested that movement trajectories can be projected using critical via-points through which the trajectory has to pass at a certain time, rather than in terms of the moment-by-moment dynamics of the implemented movement trajectory. Optimal trajectories can then be learnt by applying local optimising principles for getting from one via-point to the next. In this way, impoverished predictions can be used to monitor rich implementations. In the same way, language users might predict particularly crucial aspects of an utterance, but the aspects that they predict will depend on the circumstances. More generally, Meyer & Hagoort question the value of predicting one’s own utterance. They argue that prediction is useful when it is likely to differ from the actual event. This is the case when predicting another person’s behaviour or when the result of one’s action is uncertain (e.g., moving in a strong wind). But they argue that people are confident about their own speech. Meyer & Hagoort admit that they will tend to be less confident in dialogue, and we agree. But more important, we argue that the behaviour of the production implementer is not fully determined by the production command, because the complex processes involved in production are subject to internal (“neural”) noise or priming (i.e., influences that may not be a result of the production command). Assuming that these sources of noise do not necessarily affect forward modelling as well, predicted speech may differ from actual speech. In addition, prediction is useful even if the behaviour is fully predictable, because it allows the actor to plan future behaviour on the basis of the prediction. In fact, we made such a proposal in relation to the order of heavy and light phrases (see sect. 3.1, target article). Hartsuiker claims that our account incorrectly predicts an early competitor effect in Huettig and Hartsuiker (2010). His claim is based on the assumption that Response/Pickering & Garrod: An integrated theory of language production and comprehension",acf25d8891760616a5d1b1559d417da5a828eb8e>0caf766f329fd37a699a5c3ec62aebb1c9d44f1a_0,background,"The citation does not explicitly describe methods or results, likely providing general context."

4. Discussion,"Synaptic heterogeneity is not the only evidence for plasticity of several synaptic parameters: (1) Hebbian pairing of pre and postsynaptic neurons was shown to result in a selective increase in low frequency synaptic transmission (Markram and Tsodyks, 1996) which is due to a specific change in U (Tsodyks and Markram, 1997); (2) while presynaptic regulation of neurotransmitter release is typically considered as a mechanism to block or enhance transmission between neurons, this action rather serves to change the frequency dependence of transmission; (3) paired pulse experiments that demonstrated changes in paired pulse ratios rather demonstrated changes in frequency dependence; (4) we have recently found that an initial stage of LTDa is preceded by a selective loss of facilitation (LTDf) (A.",f1a11165ef394e3987acc4cc0056af620790b5fd>631b5d6071ec74833d779b6d5702c25a6b2be9cf_5,result,"The citation presents findings, outcomes, or conclusions from an experiment or study."

 (4) Blinding of participants, program staff, and outcome
 assessors (we did not expect most studies in this field
 to blind participants and/or facilitators, as preliminary research suggests that these interventions often involve time and personal contact)
 (5) Baseline differences between trial arms, methods of
 controlling for differences in analyses
 (6) Attrition: percentage dropout at each follow-up,
 differential attrition between trial arms, and differences between dropouts and participants who are retained
 (7) Method of outcome assessment (e.g., ACASI, bio-
 markers, self-report)
 (8) Analytic procedures: Intention to treat, complete case,
 per-protocol, or treatment-on-the-treated

,"br A recent work (Bhuiyan et al., 2004) in the SCNT bovine field demonstrated that transfected ear fibroblasts were less able to develop to the blastocyst stage than their non-transfected counterpart, regardless of passage number (early or late). More likely, discrepancies among results reported up to now are due to differences in vector type, transfection protocols (Bhuiyan et al., 2004), NT methods and donor cell culture conditions (Wells et al., 2003; Miyoshi et al., 2003). Furthermore, the site of gene(s) integration(s), the transgene used and its possible interference in endogenous gene expression could influence results (Hodges and Stice, 2003). Another aspect to consider is donor cell lines and genotypes, since Heyman et al. (2002) found that four different subcultures isolated from a single skin biopsy resulted in significantly different NT blastocyst rates (ranging from 5 to 30%), and Kühholzer et al.",39aca52b748a1e8969413295fc736ea90fd930ea>b7c9b2632ffbcef4a35a6bf0c85686d9f11c1532_2,background,"The citation provides context, references prior work, or summarizes existing knowledge."

,"br A recent work (Bhuiyan et al., 2004) in the SCNT bovine field demonstrated that transfected ear fibroblasts were less able to develop to the blastocyst stage than their non-transfected counterpart, regardless of passage number (early or late). More likely, discrepancies among results reported up to now are due to differences in vector type, transfection protocols (Bhuiyan et al., 2004), NT methods and donor cell culture conditions (Wells et al., 2003; Miyoshi et al., 2003). Furthermore, the site of gene(s) integration(s), the transgene used and its possible interference in endogenous gene expression could influence results (Hodges and Stice, 2003). Another aspect to consider is donor cell lines and genotypes, since Heyman et al. (2002) found that four different subcultures isolated from a single skin biopsy resulted in significantly different NT blastocyst rates (ranging from 5 to 30%), and Kühholzer et al. (2001) even found different morula and blastocyst rates among clonal colonies obtained from the same donor cell fetus. In our investigation of in vivo developmental capacity after transfer of NT embryos to recipient cows, we did not observe significant differences in initial pregnancy (< day 40 of gestation) rates between transfected and non-transfected donor cells, which was also reported by Zakhartchenko et al. (2001). In contrast, Forsberg et al. (2002) reported lower rates of initial pregnancy for NT of transfected cells than for NT of non-transfected cells.",39aca52b748a1e8969413295fc736ea90fd930ea>b7c9b2632ffbcef4a35a6bf0c85686d9f11c1532_5,background,"The citation provides context, references prior work, or summarizes existing knowledge."

,"Whereas Lorden used crude upper bounds for the Type I error probability that are too conservative for practical applications, Bartroff and Lai (2008) overcome this difficulty by developing numerical methods to compute the Type I error probability and also extended the three-stage test to multiparameter and multi-armed settings, thus greatly broadening the scope of these efficient adaptive designs. A review of their method is given in Section 2.1. In Section 4 we prove the asymptotic optimality of these adaptive tests in the multiparameter case, extending Lorden’s (1983) result for the special case d = 1. Another new addition to this asymptotic optimality theory of adaptive designs is related to the problem of trial extension considered in Section 2.2. As pointed out by Cui et al. (1999), the issue of increasing the maximum sample size sometimes arises after interim analysis in group sequential trials.",c530edac57ffa39997801a600c486eb231a87a6d>21b324399af869ff28634117eaaeaccfd52d371c_6,background,"The citation provides context, references prior work, or summarizes existing knowledge."

,"3 Perceived reachability Perceived reachability (PR) is a relatively new concept in IS/IT research, but has been used with research dealing with wireless technology, for example by Kim and Garrison (2009), who were among the first to incorporate PR into the TAM framework. PR refers to “an individual’s perception regarding the degree to which he or she can “reach” other individuals “anytime-and-anywhere” via mobile wireless technology” (Kim and Garrison, 2009, p. 326). Thus, PR refers to the capability to connect with others. Sales jobs can necessitate spending a considerable amount of work time away from the employer’s base, and it can be argued that mobile technology provides an ideal enhancement for salespeople. Indeed real time responses to customers improve the working processes of salespeople (Sheng et al., 2005).

,"br A recent work (Bhuiyan et al., 2004) in the SCNT bovine field demonstrated that transfected ear fibroblasts were less able to develop to the blastocyst stage than their non-transfected counterpart, regardless of passage number (early or late). More likely, discrepancies among results reported up to now are due to differences in vector type, transfection protocols (Bhuiyan et al., 2004), NT methods and donor cell culture conditions (Wells et al., 2003; Miyoshi et al., 2003). Furthermore, the site of gene(s) integration(s), the transgene used and its possible interference in endogenous gene expression could influence results (Hodges and Stice, 2003). Another aspect to consider is donor cell lines and genotypes, since Heyman et al. (2002) found that four different subcultures isolated from a single skin biopsy resulted in significantly different NT blastocyst rates (ranging from 5 to 30%), and Kühholzer et al. (2001) even found different morula and blastocyst rates among clonal colonies obtained from the same donor cell fetus.",39aca52b748a1e8969413295fc736ea90fd930ea>b7c9b2632ffbcef4a35a6bf0c85686d9f11c1532_6,background,"The citation provides context, references prior work, or summarizes existing knowledge."

EC increases gradually with increasing field moisture and plateaus when field moisture reaches maximum soil water capacity (Dalton 1995; Dietrich et al. 2013). The current research supports these previous results, as the EC increased and EI decreased following irrigation, regardless of treatments (Table 2).

,", 2012; Bergen et al., 2012) but also for studying children’s pragmatic abilities without implicitly assuming they have mastered challenging linguistic structures (Stiller et al., 2011). In this paper, we extend these results beyond simple reference games to full decision-problems in which the agents reason about language and action together over time. To do this, we use the Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP) to implement agents that are capable of manipulating the multiply-nested belief structures required for implicature calculation. Optimal decision making in Dec-POMDPs is NEXP complete, so we employ the single-agent POMDP approximation of Vogel et al. (2013). We show that agents in the Dec-POMDP reach implicature-rich interpretations simply as a byproduct of the way they reason about each other to maximize joint utility.",b97ff77e3f78c70787389c3308d72439d9aedf83>0f1de6342b4c9750f46e0bfe8a0edbf77b153c42_1,background,"The citation does not explicitly describe methods or results, likely providing general context."

,"br A recent work (Bhuiyan et al., 2004) in the SCNT bovine field demonstrated that transfected ear fibroblasts were less able to develop to the blastocyst stage than their non-transfected counterpart, regardless of passage number (early or late). More likely, discrepancies among results reported up to now are due to differences in vector type, transfection protocols (Bhuiyan et al., 2004), NT methods and donor cell culture conditions (Wells et al., 2003; Miyoshi et al., 2003). Furthermore, the site of gene(s) integration(s), the transgene used and its possible interference in endogenous gene expression could influence results (Hodges and Stice, 2003). Another aspect to consider is donor cell lines and genotypes, since Heyman et al. (2002) found that four different subcultures isolated from a single skin biopsy resulted in significantly different NT blastocyst rates (ranging from 5 to 30%), and Kühholzer et al. (2001) even found different morula and blastocyst rates among clonal colonies obtained from the same donor cell fetus. In our investigation of in vivo developmental capacity after transfer of NT embryos to recipient cows, we did not observe significant differences in initial pregnancy (< day 40 of gestation) rates between transfected and non-transfected donor cells, which was also reported by Zakhartchenko et al. (2001).

,"They initialize their orthogonal mapping using an adversarial training phase, much like Conneau et al. [2018], and solve the optimization problem with alternating minimization. Our approach differs from theirs: by bootstrapping on the solution of a smaller problem to initialize the mapping, we avoid the need for a neural network initialization that is used in their approach. In addition, our annealing scheme on the entropic regularization leads to smooth convergence, with very little sensitivity to initialization. Concurrently with our work,1 Grave et al. [2018] tackle the problem of unsupervised word embedding alignment with a similar optimization framework as the one proposed by Zhang et al. [2017b], combining Wasserstein distances (an instance of optimal transport distances) and Procrustes alignment. Their approach differs from Zhang et al. [2017b] in how they scale up optimization, by relying on a stochastic Sinkhorn solver [Genevay et al., 2018]. In addition, they initialize their approach by solving a convex relaxation of the the original problem. Although driven by a similar motivation (word embedding alignment) and relying on similar principles (joint optimization of optimal transport coupling and feature mapping) as the work of Zhang et al. [2017b] and Grave et al. [2018], our approach differs from them in several aspects.",25a58b728ebeee5bc33d753bccb89617af1cd6d6>5b97f710fe7b89887740e292d1c5e2b9f1d65b1f_5,method,"The citation describes a methodology, experimental setup, or algorithm used in the study."

,"multiple equilibria, see Albanesi et al. (2003), King and Wolman (2004) and Blake and Kirsanova (2012), and a simple New Keynesian model is not appropriate to investigate many consequences of policy delegation. As there is no particular reason to assume one equilibrium will prevail any more than another, even if the delegation schemes behave locally as intuition might suggest globally could be a different matter. The central questions addressed in this paper follow on from this. How do delegation schemes affect the likelihood of obtaining multiple equilibria in more realistic models? If multiplicity survives, how should we quantify the welfare implications of choosing one of these delegation schemes? Can any of these schemes affect the likelihood that economic agents successfully coordinate on the best equilibrium? To address these questions we study a version of the familiar sticky price model modified to incorporate capital accumulation (Sveen and Weinke, 2005; Woodford, 2005). This model contains all the features as at the heart of many DSGE models used in policy analysis which makes it a ‘representative agent’ for our policy analysis. Moreover, we choose a set up which encompasses the ‘worst case’ scenario: there are expectation traps and economic agents may be more likely to coordinate on the worst equilibrium (Dennis and Kirsanova, 2012). We confirm the previous results that all these delegation schemes can improve social welfare, but we show that they only unequivocally improve welfare if the economy remains in the best equilibrium. At the same time, we demonstrate that none of the considered delegation schemes eliminates expectation traps, moreover, new equilibria arise under delegation. Whether there is a gain associated with a transition to a delegation scheme will depend on which equilibrium under the original unmodified objective one starts from and to which equilibrium one transitions. More encouragingly, all delegation schemes reduce the range of parameters which ensure the unique worst equilibrium, thus increasing the likelihood of coordinating on the Pareto-preferred equilibrium. We also argue that a delegation scheme can change the way how agents coordinate on an equilibrium. In particular, we show that price level targeting increases the likelihood that the best equilibrium realizes. The paper is organized as follows. In the next section we outline the model and discuss the calibration. Section 3 recapitulates the analysis in Blake and Kirsanova (2012) for our sticky-price model with capital, showing how multiplicity arises when monetary policy is conducted under discretion and with an unmodified monetary policy objective.",098b03fa2d4f68c227d8046720bcbe170497618c>8fde490964c88088536693cbe2077a49aa34eca0_2,background,"The citation does not explicitly describe methods or results, likely providing general context."

,"br A recent work (Bhuiyan et al., 2004) in the SCNT bovine field demonstrated that transfected ear fibroblasts were less able to develop to the blastocyst stage than their non-transfected counterpart, regardless of passage number (early or late). More likely, discrepancies among results reported up to now are due to differences in vector type, transfection protocols (Bhuiyan et al., 2004), NT methods and donor cell culture conditions (Wells et al., 2003; Miyoshi et al., 2003). Furthermore, the site of gene(s) integration(s), the transgene used and its possible interference in endogenous gene expression could influence results (Hodges and Stice, 2003). Another aspect to consider is donor cell lines and genotypes, since Heyman et al. (2002) found that four different subcultures isolated from a single skin biopsy resulted in significantly different NT blastocyst rates (ranging from 5 to 30%), and Kühholzer et al. (2001) even found different morula and blastocyst rates among clonal colonies obtained from the same donor cell fetus. In our investigation of in vivo developmental capacity after transfer of NT embryos to recipient cows, we did not observe significant differences in initial pregnancy (< day 40 of gestation) rates between transfected and non-transfected donor cells, which was also reported by Zakhartchenko et al. (2001). In contrast, Forsberg et al. (2002) reported lower rates of initial pregnancy for NT of transfected cells than for NT of non-transfected cells. In our study, the small number of recipients carrying transgenic and non-transgenic cloned embryos precludes a conclusive result concerning embryo survival to term. Nevertheless, we suggest that to some extent transfection procedures negatively affect fetal viability, since non-transgenic pregnancies were miscarried during the first trimester of gestation, though one initial TFCE pregnancy (44 days of gestation) was interrupted. On the other hand, two pregnancies of the FCE group were carried to term. This is supported by the findings of Zakhartchenko et al. (2001) and Brophy et al. (2003) who observed a lower pregnancy rate (> day 30 of gestation) and a lower proportion of viable calves at weaning for NT using transfected cells than for their non-transfected counterpart.",39aca52b748a1e8969413295fc736ea90fd930ea>b7c9b2632ffbcef4a35a6bf0c85686d9f11c1532_8,background,"The citation provides context, references prior work, or summarizes existing knowledge."

,"They initialize their orthogonal mapping using an adversarial training phase, much like Conneau et al. [2018], and solve the optimization problem with alternating minimization. Our approach differs from theirs: by bootstrapping on the solution of a smaller problem to initialize the mapping, we avoid the need for a neural network initialization that is used in their approach. In addition, our annealing scheme on the entropic regularization leads to smooth convergence, with very little sensitivity to initialization. Concurrently with our work,1 Grave et al.

Models were tested inMplus 5.21 (Muthén andMuthén 2009) with a full information maximum likelihood (FIML) approach. Although there was some missing data at the two time points (n=651–731 for parent reported measures, n=559–693 for observed variables, including speech samples), FIML accommodates missing data and provides less biased estimates than listwise or pairwise deletion (Schafer and Graham 2002). Using FIML procedures, analyses included all participants except when they were missing data on an independent predictor that cannot be estimated with missingness (e.g., a covariate, such as poverty), resulting in an effective sample size of 728. The use of Mplus also permitted evaluation of multiple indices of model fit including Chi-square, Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), and the significance of individual paths.

1 Introduction,", 2009; Dedrick et al., 2010) have received a great deal of attention. Xing and Detert (2010) examined the case of the iPhone and found that China just contributed only 3.6% of $2.0 billion export to the US, the rest was simply a transfer from Germany, Japan, Korea, the US, and other countries. These studies rely on “tear down” analyses that assign the value of individual components to source companies and their countries. These firm- and product-based case studies can provide intuitive images of GVCs in terms of the activities of multinational enterprises. However, when we examine the Chinese economy’s role in global production networks as a whole, its share of total value added through the export of final products to the United States was actually about 75% in 2005 (Meng et al., 2011). This indicates that the “tear down” case studies focus on only the supply chain of a specific firm and particular products, and are clearly not representative of the broader role of China’s domestic production networks and inter-industrial linkages in the whole value creation process. Other work on this topic shows that domestic value added can vary substantially between different economic sectors (see Koopman et al. (forthcoming 2013), Erumban et al. (2011), Stehrer (2012), and OECD-WTO (2013).",ddcd5506231ed723abd0c296088fc166fcc2aa4a>23e6dfc7f7543f87974dc7e74ff19edfcbf4e7e2_1,background,"The citation does not explicitly describe methods or results, likely providing general context."

1. Introduction,"Some previous studies reported temporal and spatial variations of gaseous and particulate matter pollutants in China (Chai et al., 2014; Chen and Xie, 2014; Han et al., 2009; Johansson et al., 2007; Karar et al., 2006; Lewne et al., 2004; Li et al., 2014; Martini et al., 2015; Meng et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2008, 2014d; Zhang et al., 2014; Zheng et al., 2013), but detailedly observational data were scarce. Additionally, most of the studies were only limited in one single city or air pollutant. For example, based on dailymean concentrations of PM10, NO2 and SO2 for five fixed-site air monitoring stations in urban area of Guangzhou from 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2011, Li et al. (2014) analyzed timescale-dependent relationships between air pollution index (API) and a variety of meteorological factors by the wavelet analysis, and found temperature, RH (relative humidity), precipitation and wind speed were negatively correlated with API. Qu et al. (2010) also studied spatial distribution and interannual variation of PM10 mass concentrations reconstructed from API records over 86 Chinese cities between summer 2000 and winter 2006. Their results indicated PM10 concentrationswere the highest in northern China and the lowest in southern China. Recently, spatial–temporal variations ofmultiple pollutants have also been reported.

(2014d) firstly analyzed variations of six criteria pollutants in 31 capital cities from March 2013 to February 2014 based on hourly mean data released by theMinistry of Environmental Protection (MEP) of China.",1c35754e745402d9c659a15ee856528931bfb111>0369b5e89be7ebb5643b67901b848c3b95ced003_4,background,"The citation provides context, references prior work, or summarizes existing knowledge."

4. Discussion,"Cattle and sheep are thought to be the major reservoir of STEC, since the species often carry STEC in their intestinal flora and serve as a source of food contamination (Martins da Costa et al., 2011).

The results of the present study revealed the presence of two stx2 positive isolates, which were considered as STEC pathotype. On the other hand, 11% of the examined external and visceral cavity isolates were only positive for the eae gene, which were considered as EPEC strains. Moreover, one of the isolates possessed both stx2 and eae genes which is considered as highly pathogenic. This isolate belonged to phylo-groupD and phylo-subgroupD2.

,"Bentley and Haslam (1998, 1999, 2001) further explained that British postal workers adopted work practices involving AOL-related risk. Their study revealed that adopting risk-related work practices was especially linked to their work organisation, which effectively encouraged them to act less safely; to finish their working day earlier, they took shortcuts across more uneven ground and read addresses on envelopes whilst walking. During interviews, these postal workers stated that they were aware of the risks involved in their work practices, but they perceived them as more acceptable than the timewasting associated with a safer work practice. The present study found that work organisation impacted on the adoption of work practices involving greater risk. In the assembler-welder working situation, part supply problems linked to organisational deficiencies in the logistics sector obliged operators to adopt a work practice involving risk. Indeed, when available, parts could be prepared at the start of chassis assembly. Otherwise, operators had to climb more often onto, or down from, a template to collect parts (climbing down from templates being particularly unsafe). The impact of training received by operators in terms of both safety and ways of performing the required task has also been put forward by Bentley and Haslam (1998) and",0b37ac4deff5ecdf1ea165551c454f30f2e2716e>5f1c1f1ae2bad91e1cfa45e29df8295430dc95fc_3,background,"The citation does not explicitly describe methods or results, likely providing general context."

Introduction,"In a study that determined the response of the spine to sudden loads causing sagittal flexion, it was found that abdominal muscles rapidly responded to the sudden load with a large increase in muscle activation (Krajcarski et al., 1999). Also, Krajcarski et al. concluded that increases in EMG amplitudes of abdominal and trunk extensor muscles were determined predominantly by the added load magnitude and not the pre-loads. Chiang (in press) conducted a similar study with the difference being the trunk motion investigated was lateral bend instead of trunk flexion. Similar to Krajcarski et al. (1999), Chiang (in press) concluded that increased muscular activity due to pre-loads leads to increases in trunk muscle stiffness and spine stability.",551c30c8c3ffd11bb00ffef7d89fa3bec52a1102>f25f4beb189c66b5d0e805ab5a667765137f1787_6,result,"The citation presents findings, outcomes, or conclusions from an experiment or study."

,"The real-world spaces that surround information users have been diversely called everything from personal information environments (Kwasnik, 1991; Malone, 1983) to personal information management (PIM) systems (Barreau, 1995) and personal spaces of information (Jones, 2007). Drawing upon interviews with academics, Lee (2003) proposes a model of three concentric zones of information that surround a user: “immediate,” within arm’s reach or a few footsteps away; “adjacent,” such as a nearby university library; and “outside,” such as a more distant bookstore. Speaking largely from an objectifying stance and adopting Lee’s concept of the “immediate information space,” this paper focuses on a visual research method—photography— that seems particularly well suited to learning more about settings and their accompanying information phenomena. A variety of investigative approaches may be used to study immediate information space. Jones (2007) suggests ethnography combined with design methodologies, and places emphasis on context and situation, including contextual inquiry (Beyer & Holtzblatt, 1998), situated activity (Suchman, 1983), and situated design (Greenbaum & Kyng, 1991).

2.3 Funding costs and other BHC traits,"As argued by Demirgüç-Kunt and Huizinga (2004), Total cost of funds is an implicit interest rate on BHC liabilities, which is inferred from its financial statements. While Total cost of funds measures the overall cost of a BHC’s debts, it can differ across banks and time due to differences in interest rates or in the maturity and structure of a BHC’s debt. We therefore construct a second funding cost measure that focuses only on deposits. Following Gilje, Loutskina, and Strahan (2016), we measure the cost of deposits as a BHC’s interest expense on domestic deposits during a quarter divided by the stock of domestic deposits at the beginning of the quarter (Cost of domestic deposits).",b6aa0eca19a496435e446da9926beda67fd2bd86>d618979c8bc09c0a1d4cd10d74bd8002dba13c4e_0,background,"The citation does not explicitly describe methods or results, likely providing general context."

In particular, Abeler et al. study whether equal wages are considered fair and look at potentially detrimental consequences of equal wages on performance. In Section 3, we turn to a second question that becomes important when principals interact with more than one agent, namely, whether the principal can observe agents’ individual performance or only the outcomes of the group of agents as a whole. We present a recent study by Kleine and Kube (2010) that addresses the question whether reporting (subjective) performance measures can enhance the efficiency of interaction in work groups. Next, we discuss a study by Schneider and Kube (2006) that analyzes how differences in social proximity affect gift exchange in multi-worker firms.",10dd055d4276a7c2f17192717a22d824783c48cb>0d10e553c0a46e7384b3c34dc45bb063843a8300_3,result,"The citation presents findings, outcomes, or conclusions from an experiment or study."

,"The term lesser known species does not imply that the species are unknown, but rather they presently constitute the bulk of wood that finds no economic use (Barany et al. 2003). Hansom (1983) and ITTO (2007) described lesser-known species as those species for which current commercial demand is below their forest production potentials. Freezaillah (1984) also defined an LKS as a commercially less accepted species left in the forest after a logging operation. In this context, LKS have also been called secondary species, unpopular species, non-obligatory species and weed species. More efficient species utilization of LKS requires information on their technical, physical andchemical properties, as well as availability and abundance. This information is very important in maintaining the sustainability of tropical ecosystems, especially species diversity. According to Freezaillah (1984), about 93% of tropical forest volume consists of LKS, many of which are presently being burnt or otherwise wasted through logging operations, agricultural conversion (including shifting cultivation), hydroelectricity projects and conversion into plantations.",f473f30f0bf35b7e97874cefc66e9a6dacc4eae8>f5191ac6456c5df72545a8ddee851f0c4fbe378f_1,background,"The citation provides context, references prior work, or summarizes existing knowledge."
Method,"145) and is particularly useful for studying social phenomena about which little is known (Beck, 2004; Wuest, 2007). Because the goal of grounded theory is to generate a formal substantive theory that accounts for a main concern and pattern of behavior that is relevant to those involved (Glaser, 1978), it was a logical approach to examining what men find most challenging about responding to experiences of WPB and how they went about addressing these challenges, an area about which little is known. The focus on contextual influences that is characteristic of grounded theory allowed us to explore and understand factors that accounted for variation in how men responded to bullying such as gender. Even though our approach to grounded theory is rooted in the original strategies outlined by Glaser and Strauss (1967) and subsequent writings by Glaser (1978, 1992, 1998), we believe that knowledge gained from research is shaped by both the researcher and participants and thus is socially constructed (Charmaz, 2003).",e300bde47ff38b78bd09fc3566e9c3b5a0aa21e5>6cd197b734868a247cbe0564c4e856d68bc8652c_2,background,"The citation provides context, references prior work, or summarizes existing knowledge."

Liu et al.

,"They initialize their orthogonal mapping using an adversarial training phase, much like Conneau et al. [2018], and solve the optimization problem with alternating minimization. Our approach differs from theirs: by bootstrapping on the solution of a smaller problem to initialize the mapping, we avoid the need for a neural network initialization that is used in their approach. In addition, our annealing scheme on the entropic regularization leads to smooth convergence, with very little sensitivity to initialization. Concurrently with our work,1 Grave et al. [2018] tackle the problem of unsupervised word embedding alignment with a similar optimization framework as the one proposed by Zhang et al. [2017b], combining Wasserstein distances (an instance of optimal transport distances) and Procrustes alignment. Their approach differs from Zhang et al. [2017b] in how they scale up optimization, by relying on a stochastic Sinkhorn solver [Genevay et al., 2018]. In addition, they initialize their approach by solving a convex relaxation of the the original problem.

,"1998), to provide great £exibility in testing evolutionary hypotheses (Huelsenbeck & Rannala 1997), and simply to give excellent results in the inference of evolutionary relationships (Kuhner & Felsenstein 1994; Huelsenbeck 1995). Constraints imposed by computational complexity are becoming less restrictive as computers improve. Given the recognition of phylogenetic inference as being inherently statistical in nature, it is surprising that so little attention has been paid to experimental design. A number of topics of relevance to experimental design in phylogenetics have been discussed previously. There is something of a folklore surrounding the choice of genes or other genomic regions for investigating particular evolutionary questions, but almost no published quantitative results. It is widely accepted that sequences that have undergone very little evolutionary change since their divergence from a common ancestor, through low substitution rates or short evolutionary times, will exhibit too few di¡erences to contain useful evolutionary information. Equally, sequences that have undergone very large amounts of change (high rates or long times) become `saturated' with changes and no evolutionary signal is detectable amid the noise. Consequently, a happy medium is expected at some intermediate level of sequence divergence, but the àsymptotic' results (for extreme high and low levels of divergence) give no clue as to where this lies. Although there is considerable experience with particular genes and organisms (see Hillis et al. (1996, pp. 336^339) for an extensive list of studies), where comparisons among genes have been made they tend to be evaluated empirically by the congruence of the results obtained among themselves and with researchers'a priori expectations. In addition, a large laboratory e¡ort is needed before even these qualitative conclusions can be reached. The methods introduced in this paper can quantify the e¡ects of varying levels of divergence. They con¢rm the belief that intermediate levels of sequence divergence are most useful, and are able to give estimates of optimal levels of divergence. The necessary analyses can be done before any data are collected. The only other method for assessing which genomic regions are likely to be most useful in phylogenetic questions is that of Yang (1998). This uses simulation to estimate probabilities of successful tree-topology inference. The approach may be extremely time-consuming for realistic problems. The choice of taxa to include in phylogenetic studies has also rarely been discussed. Li et al. (1987) considered the e¡ects of adding outgroup taxa, and Ritland & Clegg (1990) and Maddison et al. (1992) are agreed that if outgroups are to be added, they should not be too distantly related to the ingroup taxa (a conclusion that is con¢rmed in this paper). More recently, consideration of the estimation of large phylogenies has led to the contradictory advice that the number of sequences included in a study be reduced (Kim 1996) and increased (particularly to break long branches in trees (Hillis 1996)) in order to improve inferences (see also Hillis 1998). Although it is not clear that the latter strategy will always be successful (Zharkikh & Li 1993; Kim 1996), Strimmer & von Haeseler (1996) and Hillis (1996) have",a1f8b013b71d089af43911a37d22260e889e82c4>e0cbb949d062a1134c4d98924f51312090e76514_5,method,"The citation describes a methodology, experimental setup, or algorithm used in the study."

,"These properties have been noticed by others who used ̂κ in place of ̂ (Friedman 1989; Brown et al. 1999), and they can be exploited to reduce the computation time for regularized discriminant analysis in high-dimensional settings (Hastie and Tibshirani 2004). • R̂λ can be calculated by multiplying all off-diagonal elements of R̂ by λ. • The proposed regularization will reduce the bias inherent in eigenvalues of sample correlation matrices (Friedman 1989), provided that a reasonable choice of regularization parameter λ is used. Bias generally will not be completely removed. • R̂λ manages a bias–variance trade-off; R̂ has potentially high variance but relatively little bias (being asymptotically unbiased for large N , fixed p), and I has no variance, but is biased for R in general. Thus, loosely speaking, R̂λ can be thought of as a weighted average of a variance term and a bias term, and we aim to choose λ to optimize this bias–variance trade-off.

,"1998), to provide great £exibility in testing evolutionary hypotheses (Huelsenbeck & Rannala 1997), and simply to give excellent results in the inference of evolutionary relationships (Kuhner & Felsenstein 1994; Huelsenbeck 1995). Constraints imposed by computational complexity are becoming less restrictive as computers improve. Given the recognition of phylogenetic inference as being inherently statistical in nature, it is surprising that so little attention has been paid to experimental design. A number of topics of relevance to experimental design in phylogenetics have been discussed previously. There is something of a folklore surrounding the choice of genes or other genomic regions for investigating particular evolutionary questions, but almost no published quantitative results. It is widely accepted that sequences that have undergone very little evolutionary change since their divergence from a common ancestor, through low substitution rates or short evolutionary times, will exhibit too few di¡erences to contain useful evolutionary information. Equally, sequences that have undergone very large amounts of change (high rates or long times) become `saturated' with changes and no evolutionary signal is detectable amid the noise. Consequently, a happy medium is expected at some intermediate level of sequence divergence, but the àsymptotic' results (for extreme high and low levels of divergence) give no clue as to where this lies. Although there is considerable experience with particular genes and organisms (see Hillis et al. (1996, pp. 336^339) for an extensive list of studies), where comparisons among genes have been made they tend to be evaluated empirically by the congruence of the results obtained among themselves and with researchers'a priori expectations. In addition, a large laboratory e¡ort is needed before even these qualitative conclusions can be reached. The methods introduced in this paper can quantify the e¡ects of varying levels of divergence. They con¢rm the belief that intermediate levels of sequence divergence are most useful, and are able to give estimates of optimal levels of divergence. The necessary analyses can be done before any data are collected. The only other method for assessing which genomic regions are likely to be most useful in phylogenetic questions is that of Yang (1998). This uses simulation to estimate probabilities of successful tree-topology inference. The approach may be extremely time-consuming for realistic problems. The choice of taxa to include in phylogenetic studies has also rarely been discussed. Li et al. (1987) considered the e¡ects of adding outgroup taxa, and Ritland & Clegg (1990) and Maddison et al. (1992) are agreed that if outgroups are to be added, they should not be too distantly related to the ingroup taxa (a conclusion that is con¢rmed in this paper).",a1f8b013b71d089af43911a37d22260e889e82c4>e0cbb949d062a1134c4d98924f51312090e76514_2,method,"The citation describes a methodology, experimental setup, or algorithm used in the study."

Introduction,"In a study that determined the response of the spine to sudden loads causing sagittal flexion, it was found that abdominal muscles rapidly responded to the sudden load with a large increase in muscle activation (Krajcarski et al., 1999). Also, Krajcarski et al. concluded that increases in EMG amplitudes of abdominal and trunk extensor muscles were determined predominantly by the added load magnitude and not the pre-loads. Chiang (in press) conducted a similar study with the difference being the trunk motion investigated was lateral bend instead of trunk flexion. Similar to Krajcarski et al. (1999), Chiang (in press) concluded that increased muscular activity due to pre-loads leads to increases in trunk muscle stiffness and spine stability. Krajcarski et al (1999) and Chiang (in press) have provided a greater understanding of the active muscular response that is responsible for maintaining stability.",551c30c8c3ffd11bb00ffef7d89fa3bec52a1102>f25f4beb189c66b5d0e805ab5a667765137f1787_5,result,"The citation presents findings, outcomes, or conclusions from an experiment or study."

,"The real-world spaces that surround information users have been diversely called everything from personal information environments (Kwasnik, 1991; Malone, 1983) to personal information management (PIM) systems (Barreau, 1995) and personal spaces of information (Jones, 2007). Drawing upon interviews with academics, Lee (2003) proposes a model of three concentric zones of information that surround a user: “immediate,” within arm’s reach or a few footsteps away; “adjacent,” such as a nearby university library; and “outside,” such as a more distant bookstore. Speaking largely from an objectifying stance and adopting Lee’s concept of the “immediate information space,” this paper focuses on a visual research method—photography— that seems particularly well suited to learning more about settings and their accompanying information phenomena. A variety of investigative approaches may be used to study immediate information space. Jones (2007) suggests ethnography combined with design methodologies, and places emphasis on context and situation, including contextual inquiry (Beyer & Holtzblatt, 1998), situated activity (Suchman, 1983), and situated design (Greenbaum & Kyng, 1991).",684872304caa8ff076c9b6a01e3baf2bedb9d3fe>92cc6d034017530cfcd5934b2e3f1b72d542e61b_2,method,"The citation describes a methodology, experimental setup, or algorithm used in the study."

,"In addition to the trophies and prizes, HBC members gain ‘ball status’ by moving up the ball status hierarchy, comprised of Statement, Star, Legend, and, ultimately Icon statuses, which are based on the number of years in the community, number of awards or trophies amassed, recognition within a particular category, and the number of balls participated in through the years (Galindo, 2013; personal communication with POSSE CAB). Competition can also be heightened through the use of ‘shade’ – backhanded remarks offered by judges or other ball participants (Galindo, 2013). In addition to the formal HBC, there is an emergent ‘Kiki’ or family scene that parallels the House structure but does not maintain the formal relationships that are maintained within the Houses. For example, the families can be formed without a particular House parent and the names are not linked to designers or House founders (i.e. Mafia, Foxx, Golden, Kardashian) (Alonzo Gibson, personal communication 8/14/2015). The family scene emerged as an attempt to reject the perceived rigidity of the Ball scene for up and coming participants. In particular, families formed as an opportunity to provide a safe space where youth could practice ‘vogueing’ and other ball competition skills without experiencing the shade or ‘chopping’ (being cut from the category by judges) that occurs during the competitions. Family scene members may move into the Houses as they get more skilled but they may also remain independent of the Houses and still participate in the balls. This new scene provides new opportunities for youth to become involved in the Ball scene without necessarily belonging to a particular House. The HBC thrives, in part, by serving as an in-group for youth who are so frequently excluded from acceptance within more dominant groups (Rowan et al., 2013). Additionally, the HBC provides both the much-needed acceptance and support that they lack in other contexts, and a safe outlet for expression, camaraderie, and fun. Therefore, although the HBC is a socially constructed space, it is one of few spaces in which Black GBT youth are able to fully embody their multiple identities in a safe space. For example, Kubicek, McNeeley, Holloway, Weiss, and Kipke (2013) observed the acceptance of gender and sexual fluidity of many of the House members and Ball participants.",3ad3837dbb7812a0baf839d8eb88f50035cab156>6b85dce37b745ebafac661f6fad5bfad943f1513_4,background,"The citation does not explicitly describe methods or results, likely providing general context."

Discussion,"25 (Carlson and Seamons 2008). Although this is a modest value, it does provide ample opportunity for natural selection to operate. The other condition – a selective differential – is clearly met. Hydropower development has profoundly changed freshwater environmental conditions experienced by Snake River fall Chinook salmon, so ample reason exists to believe that selective pressures for age at smolting could have changed as well. Our analyses suggest that the possibility of rapid evolutionary change in juvenile migration tactic within the last 50–60 years. Credence is lent to this hypothesis by research that has concluded that evolutionary changes have been experienced by introduced Chinook salmon populations over a 90-year period in New Zealand. There, Unwin et al. (2000) documented a divergence in juvenile migratory timing associated with differences in water temperatures that had affected juvenile growth, an association similar to that observed in Snake River fall Chinook salmon.",c26c04b9703e3b6d585f22ffcf2ba13f9c797909>1b930af457f9a29a23626da2993afa54332013c0_0,background,"The citation does not explicitly describe methods or results, likely providing general context."
