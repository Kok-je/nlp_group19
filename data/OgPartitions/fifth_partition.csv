,"The real-world spaces that surround information users have been diversely called everything from personal information environments (Kwasnik, 1991; Malone, 1983) to personal information management (PIM) systems (Barreau, 1995) and personal spaces of information (Jones, 2007). Drawing upon interviews with academics, Lee (2003) proposes a model of three concentric zones of information that surround a user: “immediate,” within arm’s reach or a few footsteps away; “adjacent,” such as a nearby university library; and “outside,” such as a more distant bookstore. Speaking largely from an objectifying stance and adopting Lee’s concept of the “immediate information space,” this paper focuses on a visual research method—photography— that seems particularly well suited to learning more about settings and their accompanying information phenomena. A variety of investigative approaches may be used to study immediate information space. Jones (2007) suggests ethnography combined with design methodologies, and places emphasis on context and situation, including contextual inquiry (Beyer & Holtzblatt, 1998), situated activity (Suchman, 1983), and situated design (Greenbaum & Kyng, 1991). Naumer and Fisher (2007) recommend naturalistic inquiry (Lincoln & Guba, 1985) and the data-gathering methods of unobtrusive observation, interviews, diaries, text analysis, pictures, and videos."

2.3 Funding costs and other BHC traits,"As argued by Demirgüç-Kunt and Huizinga (2004), Total cost of funds is an implicit interest rate on BHC liabilities, which is inferred from its financial statements. While Total cost of funds measures the overall cost of a BHC’s debts, it can differ across banks and time due to differences in interest rates or in the maturity and structure of a BHC’s debt. We therefore construct a second funding cost measure that focuses only on deposits. Following Gilje, Loutskina, and Strahan (2016), we measure the cost of deposits as a BHC’s interest expense on domestic deposits during a quarter divided by the stock of domestic deposits at the beginning of the quarter (Cost of domestic deposits)."

,"The term lesser known species does not imply that the species are unknown, but rather they presently constitute the bulk of wood that finds no economic use (Barany et al. 2003). Hansom (1983) and ITTO (2007) described lesser-known species as those species for which current commercial demand is below their forest production potentials. Freezaillah (1984) also defined an LKS as a commercially less accepted species left in the forest after a logging operation. In this context, LKS have also been called secondary species, unpopular species, non-obligatory species and weed species. More efficient species utilization of LKS requires information on their technical, physical andchemical properties, as well as availability and abundance. This information is very important in maintaining the sustainability of tropical ecosystems, especially species diversity. According to Freezaillah (1984), about 93% of tropical forest volume consists of LKS, many of which are presently being burnt or otherwise wasted through logging operations, agricultural conversion (including shifting cultivation), hydroelectricity projects and conversion into plantations."
Method,"145) and is particularly useful for studying social phenomena about which little is known (Beck, 2004; Wuest, 2007). Because the goal of grounded theory is to generate a formal substantive theory that accounts for a main concern and pattern of behavior that is relevant to those involved (Glaser, 1978), it was a logical approach to examining what men find most challenging about responding to experiences of WPB and how they went about addressing these challenges, an area about which little is known. The focus on contextual influences that is characteristic of grounded theory allowed us to explore and understand factors that accounted for variation in how men responded to bullying such as gender. Even though our approach to grounded theory is rooted in the original strategies outlined by Glaser and Strauss (1967) and subsequent writings by Glaser (1978, 1992, 1998), we believe that knowledge gained from research is shaped by both the researcher and participants and thus is socially constructed (Charmaz, 2003)."

The data that we have obtained in the present work on the Purkinje cell pairs would suggest that, among those cells, the level of mutant mtDNA varied very little from cell to cell. Thus, the mosaic phenotype observed by Sparaco et al. (1995) may have arisen from a failure of the residual wild-type DNA to complement the mutant DNA in some cells because of an unfavorable segregation of the two genotypes within the cells."

DISCUSSION,"Eicosanoids derived from AA, including PGE2, TBX2, and LTB4, are more proinflammatory than those derived from DHA (Calder, 2006). The results of our study confirmed this pathway of eicosanoid formation. Chickens fed LR diets had significantly lower levels of PGE2 and TBX2 in the blood than those fed HR diets. These results are in agreement with those of Cherian et al. (2009), who showed that the level of incorporation of n-3 FA was higher, but that of AA in cardiac ventricle lipids was lower, and the levels of PGE2 and TBX2 in the blood of progeny (7-, 14-, 28- and 42-day-old chickens) were lower after feeding HR diets to broiler hens. Liu et al. (2014) reported significantly lower levels of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids (PGE2 and TBX2) in the plasma due to inhibition of phospholipase A2 activity in chickens fed diets rich in PUFA n-3 than in chickens fed diets rich in PUFA n-6."

,"They initialize their orthogonal mapping using an adversarial training phase, much like Conneau et al. [2018], and solve the optimization problem with alternating minimization. Our approach differs from theirs: by bootstrapping on the solution of a smaller problem to initialize the mapping, we avoid the need for a neural network initialization that is used in their approach. In addition, our annealing scheme on the entropic regularization leads to smooth convergence, with very little sensitivity to initialization. Concurrently with our work,1 Grave et al. [2018] tackle the problem of unsupervised word embedding alignment with a similar optimization framework as the one proposed by Zhang et al. [2017b], combining Wasserstein distances (an instance of optimal transport distances) and Procrustes alignment. Their approach differs from Zhang et al. [2017b] in how they scale up optimization, by relying on a stochastic Sinkhorn solver [Genevay et al., 2018]. In addition, they initialize their approach by solving a convex relaxation of the the original problem.

,"1998), to provide great £exibility in testing evolutionary hypotheses (Huelsenbeck & Rannala 1997), and simply to give excellent results in the inference of evolutionary relationships (Kuhner & Felsenstein 1994; Huelsenbeck 1995). Constraints imposed by computational complexity are becoming less restrictive as computers improve. Given the recognition of phylogenetic inference as being inherently statistical in nature, it is surprising that so little attention has been paid to experimental design. A number of topics of relevance to experimental design in phylogenetics have been discussed previously. There is something of a folklore surrounding the choice of genes or other genomic regions for investigating particular evolutionary questions, but almost no published quantitative results. It is widely accepted that sequences that have undergone very little evolutionary change since their divergence from a common ancestor, through low substitution rates or short evolutionary times, will exhibit too few di¡erences to contain useful evolutionary information. Equally, sequences that have undergone very large amounts of change (high rates or long times) become `saturated' with changes and no evolutionary signal is detectable amid the noise. Consequently, a happy medium is expected at some intermediate level of sequence divergence, but the àsymptotic' results (for extreme high and low levels of divergence) give no clue as to where this lies. Although there is considerable experience with particular genes and organisms (see Hillis et al. (1996, pp. 336^339) for an extensive list of studies), where comparisons among genes have been made they tend to be evaluated empirically by the congruence of the results obtained among themselves and with researchers'a priori expectations. In addition, a large laboratory e¡ort is needed before even these qualitative conclusions can be reached. The methods introduced in this paper can quantify the e¡ects of varying levels of divergence. They con¢rm the belief that intermediate levels of sequence divergence are most useful, and are able to give estimates of optimal levels of divergence. The necessary analyses can be done before any data are collected. The only other method for assessing which genomic regions are likely to be most useful in phylogenetic questions is that of Yang (1998). This uses simulation to estimate probabilities of successful tree-topology inference. The approach may be extremely time-consuming for realistic problems. The choice of taxa to include in phylogenetic studies has also rarely been discussed. Li et al. (1987) considered the e¡ects of adding outgroup taxa, and Ritland & Clegg (1990) and Maddison et al. (1992) are agreed that if outgroups are to be added, they should not be too distantly related to the ingroup taxa (a conclusion that is con¢rmed in this paper). More recently, consideration of the estimation of large phylogenies has led to the contradictory advice that the number of sequences included in a study be reduced (Kim 1996) and increased (particularly to break long branches in trees (Hillis 1996)) in order to improve inferences (see also Hillis 1998). Although it is not clear that the latter strategy will always be successful (Zharkikh & Li 1993; Kim 1996), Strimmer & von Haeseler (1996) and Hillis (1996) have"

Bias generally will not be completely removed. • R̂λ manages a bias–variance trade-off; R̂ has potentially high variance but relatively little bias (being asymptotically unbiased for large N , fixed p), and I has no variance, but is biased for R in general. Thus, loosely speaking, R̂λ can be thought of as a weighted average of a variance term and a bias term, and we aim to choose λ to optimize this bias–variance trade-off. Ledoit and Wolf (2004) previously made this point for ̂κ ."
