Methods,"A modified version of the ‚ÄùMaze Game‚Äù, devised by Garrod and Anderson (1987) was developed. This task creates a recurrent need for pairs of participants to produce location descriptions.

Alignment of the category of description used by participants can then be used as an index of semantic coordination (Garrod and Anderson, 1987; Garrod and Doherty, 1994). To support turn-level experimental manipulations of the dialogues the chat-tool technique described by Healey, Purver, King, Ginzburg, and Mills (2003) was used."

,"1998), to provide great £exibility in testing evolutionary hypotheses (Huelsenbeck & Rannala 1997), and simply to give excellent results in the inference of evolutionary relationships (Kuhner & Felsenstein 1994; Huelsenbeck 1995). Constraints imposed by computational complexity are becoming less restrictive as computers improve. Given the recognition of phylogenetic inference as being inherently statistical in nature, it is surprising that so little attention has been paid to experimental design. A number of topics of relevance to experimental design in phylogenetics have been discussed previously. There is something of a folklore surrounding the choice of genes or other genomic regions for investigating particular evolutionary questions, but almost no published quantitative results. It is widely accepted that sequences that have undergone very little evolutionary change since their divergence from a common ancestor, through low substitution rates or short evolutionary times, will exhibit too few di¡erences to contain useful evolutionary information. Equally, sequences that have undergone very large amounts of change (high rates or long times) become `saturated' with changes and no evolutionary signal is detectable amid the noise. Consequently, a happy medium is expected at some intermediate level of sequence divergence, but the àsymptotic' results (for extreme high and low levels of divergence) give no clue as to where this lies. Although there is considerable experience with particular genes and organisms (see Hillis et al. (1996, pp. 336^339) for an extensive list of studies), where comparisons among genes have been made they tend to be evaluated empirically by the congruence of the results obtained among themselves and with researchers'a priori expectations. In addition, a large laboratory e¡ort is needed before even these qualitative conclusions can be reached. The methods introduced in this paper can quantify the e¡ects of varying levels of divergence. They con¢rm the belief that intermediate levels of sequence divergence are most useful, and are able to give estimates of optimal levels of divergence. The necessary analyses can be done before any data are collected. The only other method for assessing which genomic regions are likely to be most useful in phylogenetic questions is that of Yang (1998). This uses simulation to estimate probabilities of successful tree-topology inference. The approach may be extremely time-consuming for realistic problems. The choice of taxa to include in phylogenetic studies has also rarely been discussed. Li et al. (1987) considered the e¡ects of adding outgroup taxa, and Ritland & Clegg (1990) and Maddison et al."

Note that the perceived orientation of any specific outdoor hill may depend on a variety of factors in addition to its physical slant (e.g., curvature and viewing distance), but if the free-hand measure represents the NSE orientation, then we should expect the relationship between verbal estimates and free hand (NSE) estimates to remain similar to that observed for near surfaces. In other words, we should be able to make a prediction about the verbal estimates based on the free-hand estimates. ----- Figure 7 to be inserted here ----Figure 7 shows Stigliani et al.’s (2010) numeric estimation data for outdoor slopes plotted against the corresponding free-hand estimates (NSE) for each physical path (physical path inclination is shown next to each data point)."

,"For example, Kawato et al. (1990) suggested that movement trajectories can be projected using critical via-points through which the trajectory has to pass at a certain time, rather than in terms of the moment-by-moment dynamics of the implemented movement trajectory. Optimal trajectories can then be learnt by applying local optimising principles for getting from one via-point to the next. In this way, impoverished predictions can be used to monitor rich implementations. In the same way, language users might predict particularly crucial aspects of an utterance, but the aspects that they predict will depend on the circumstances. More generally, Meyer & Hagoort question the value of predicting one’s own utterance. They argue that prediction is useful when it is likely to differ from the actual event. This is the case when predicting another person’s behaviour or when the result of one’s action is uncertain (e.g., moving in a strong wind). But they argue that people are confident about their own speech. Meyer & Hagoort admit that they will tend to be less confident in dialogue, and we agree. But more important, we argue that the behaviour of the production implementer is not fully determined by the production command, because the complex processes involved in production are subject to internal (“neural”) noise or priming (i.e., influences that may not be a result of the production command). Assuming that these sources of noise do not necessarily affect forward modelling as well, predicted speech may differ from actual speech. In addition, prediction is useful even if the behaviour is fully predictable, because it allows the actor to plan future behaviour on the basis of the prediction. In fact, we made such a proposal in relation to the order of heavy and light phrases (see sect. 3.1, target article). Hartsuiker claims that our account incorrectly predicts an early competitor effect in Huettig and Hartsuiker (2010). His claim is based on the assumption that Response/Pickering & Garrod: An integrated theory of language production and comprehension"

4. Discussion,"Synaptic heterogeneity is not the only evidence for plasticity of several synaptic parameters: (1) Hebbian pairing of pre and postsynaptic neurons was shown to result in a selective increase in low frequency synaptic transmission (Markram and Tsodyks, 1996) which is due to a specific change in U (Tsodyks and Markram, 1997); (2) while presynaptic regulation of neurotransmitter release is typically considered as a mechanism to block or enhance transmission between neurons, this action rather serves to change the frequency dependence of transmission; (3) paired pulse experiments that demonstrated changes in paired pulse ratios rather demonstrated changes in frequency dependence; (4) we have recently found that an initial stage of LTDa is preceded by a selective loss of facilitation (LTDf) (A."
