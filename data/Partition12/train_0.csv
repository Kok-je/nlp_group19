,"1998), to provide great £exibility in testing evolutionary hypotheses (Huelsenbeck & Rannala 1997), and simply to give excellent results in the inference of evolutionary relationships (Kuhner & Felsenstein 1994; Huelsenbeck 1995). Constraints imposed by computational complexity are becoming less restrictive as computers improve. Given the recognition of phylogenetic inference as being inherently statistical in nature, it is surprising that so little attention has been paid to experimental design. A number of topics of relevance to experimental design in phylogenetics have been discussed previously. There is something of a folklore surrounding the choice of genes or other genomic regions for investigating particular evolutionary questions, but almost no published quantitative results. It is widely accepted that sequences that have undergone very little evolutionary change since their divergence from a common ancestor, through low substitution rates or short evolutionary times, will exhibit too few di¡erences to contain useful evolutionary information. Equally, sequences that have undergone very large amounts of change (high rates or long times) become `saturated' with changes and no evolutionary signal is detectable amid the noise. Consequently, a happy medium is expected at some intermediate level of sequence divergence, but the àsymptotic' results (for extreme high and low levels of divergence) give no clue as to where this lies. Although there is considerable experience with particular genes and organisms (see Hillis et al. (1996, pp. 336^339) for an extensive list of studies), where comparisons among genes have been made they tend to be evaluated empirically by the congruence of the results obtained among themselves and with researchers'a priori expectations. In addition, a large laboratory e¡ort is needed before even these qualitative conclusions can be reached. The methods introduced in this paper can quantify the e¡ects of varying levels of divergence. They con¢rm the belief that intermediate levels of sequence divergence are most useful, and are able to give estimates of optimal levels of divergence. The necessary analyses can be done before any data are collected. The only other method for assessing which genomic regions are likely to be most useful in phylogenetic questions is that of Yang (1998). This uses simulation to estimate probabilities of successful tree-topology inference. The approach may be extremely time-consuming for realistic problems. The choice of taxa to include in phylogenetic studies has also rarely been discussed. Li et al. (1987) considered the e¡ects of adding outgroup taxa, and Ritland & Clegg (1990) and Maddison et al."

INTRODUCTION,"CGRP increases the proliferation of osteoblasts (9,17), prevents bone loss when delivered systemically to ovariectomized (OVX) rats (18)."
1. Introduction,"GSH/GSSG, reduced PC/oxidised PC, and reduced Protein/oxidised Protein) can protect cells from oxidative damage (Tsuji et al., 2002), this produces an imbalance in the redox status that may lead to other unwanted effects such as changes in intracellular pH, which is, to our knowledge, an effect that has not been explored to date."
Juvenile survival and dispersal,"The persistence of arctic ground squirrels in the low elevation-meadow and alpinemeadow habitats in 2008–10, and the simultaneous extirpation of ground squirrels from the boreal forest since 1998 (Donker and Krebs 2011), provides supportive evidence that the boreal forest is functioning as sink habitat for arctic ground squirrels."
Discussion,"As previously demonstrated by our group (20), the BHT model resembles human UIP because of clear evidence of alveolar collapse and chronic scarring, typically patchy subpleural or paraseptal distribution, evidence of active fibrosis as fibroblastic foci, and intervening normal areas."
Discussion,"In agreement, repression of Fgf signalling results in a similar but much stronger phenotype compared to down-regulation of Satb1, with all ICM cells expressing EPI lineage markers (Frankenberg et al., 2011; Yamanaka et al., 2010)."
Keywords:,"Our results are in agreement with previous ones (Gabrielson et al., 2002; Al-Bakri and Afifi, 2007), so that such assays seem to be not particularly useful for enterococci."
Anthropometric Measurements,"’s [14] study had an exercise regimen consisting of a variety of endurance activities which included a cross-training mix of treadmill walking/jogging, stationary cycling, seated rowing, stationary stair climbing and weight training."
Triplex and quadruplex systems,"movements that are relevant to late stages of folding, as described elsewhere (60,78)."
Results and discussion,"This is regarded as the onset of the average Si-O coordination number increasing from 6 to 6+ (“6+-fold (Si)” in this figure) in each glass (see Murakami and Bass 2010, 2011)."
4. DISCUSSION,"Demonstration of intrathecal immunoglobulin and antibody synthesis are powerful tools for diagnosis of neurological disorders, as has been shown for multiple sclerosis and several infectious diseases of the CNS (Reiber and Lange, 1991; Felgenhauer and Reiber, 1992; Andersson et al., 1994; Tumani et al., 1995; Reiber and Peter, 2001)."
Discussion,"‚Äö√Ñ¬∂in cuticle thickness reported
 here is in agreement with other studies which show that cuticle thickness increases (e.g. Gratani and Bonito 2009; Varone and Gratani 2009) and wax formation continues (e.g. Bukovac et al. 1979; Gu√É√†lz et al. 1991; McWhorter et al. 1990) throughout leaf expansion."
Methods,LASTZ represents a new implementation of the previous BLASTZ (30) algorithm and includes several improvements (29).
2.1 Resummation of threshold logarithms at NNLL,"each capture the contributions of classes of radiation effects: hard, collinear and wide-angle soft radiation [34–39]."
5.3 Experiments on the IC model,"We compare SISI with the dynamic programming algorithm, temporarily called k-effector, in [21] when the infection process follows the IC model."
5. METHODOLOGY,Figure 6 shows the segmentation of the AVG page with the implementation of the BOM approach.
Methods,"The membrane fluorescence and lipid fluidity of cells were measured in accordance with the method described by Shinitzky and Inbar [30, 31]."
,"On the other hand, transgenes were expressed in the central nervous system and in the retina, tissues where collagen VI was not detected (Marvulli et al., 1996)."
Lynn B. Martin II and Lisa Fitzgerald,", 2003), none identify specific mechanisms by which successful invaders establish and expand their new ranges (Ehrlich, 1989; Mack et al., 2000; Viet and Lewis, 1996)."
Results,"The update rule above is a special instance of a more general experience-weighted attraction rule [12, 18], which has been shown to be in reasonable agreement with experimental data on human learning in repeated games."
Introduction,RNA molecules are extremely sensitive and easily degraded by ribonucleases (RNases) or contaminated by genomic DNA during the isolation process (Schroeder et al. 2006).
Discussion,"The third model, which assumes unrelatedness, accounts for the possibility “that the blunted VS response as observed in individuals with ADHD is related to additional disease-related factors and not trait impulsivity per se” (20)."
3.4 Implementation Details,"For the linguistic feature extraction phase we wrapped several state-of-the-art NLP tools: Stanford CoreNLP12 for POS, NERC, TERN, and coreference resolution; mate-tools13 for DP and SRL, with mappings between frame resources from the Predicate Matrix [10]; DBpedia Spotlight14 for EL; and, UKB15 for WSD."
RESULTS,"Firstly, the intracellular phosphoprotein networks investigated (pathways or single mediators integrating signaling through several pathways) are important for downstream signaling from growth factor receptors commonly expressed by primary human AML cells [12, 13]."
Immunohistochemistry and histology,"For cartilage staining, embryos were fixed for 2 hours to overnight in buffered 4% formaldehyde, rinsed briefly in distilled water and transferred directly into a 0.1% solution of Alcian blue to stain overnight (Dingerkus and Uhler, 1977)."
Discussion,"This probably contributes to a fast down-regulation of the fulllength ABI3 in ripe seeds, which is necessary to inhibit the seed maturation program in germinating seeds (Sugliani et al. 2010)."
4 Implementation,"In the first pass, we display the diffuse lobe of the BRDF through spherical harmonic environment map rendering [Ramamoorthi and Hanrahan 2001]."
Methodology,"Scientometric studies employing bibliometric analyses have been used on many occasions to study scientific specialty profiles (e.g., Rorissa and Yuan 2012; Bajwa et al. 2013; Sanz-Casado et al. 2013) and domain mapping (e.g., White and McCain 1998; Reid and Chen 2007; Liu et al. 2015)."
Introduction,"During this differentiation, the bacterium forms a cytoplasmic region of size half the cell’s length and a large periplasmic region with a small invasion tip (Iwatani et al., 2005)."
Introduction,"This condition has been described variously, as intramural coronary artery, mural coronary artery, coronary artery overbridging, and most commonly myocardial bridging (MB) (Canyigit et al. 2009; Lazoura et al. 2010; Mohlenkamp et al. 2002; Montaudon et al. 2007; Ozbag et al. 2002; Ozbag and Kervancioglu 2004)."
1. Introduction,", 2010), and consequently breast biomechanics research has made recommendations to wear a high level of breast support (sports bra) when exercising to reduce breast pain (Bridgman et al., 2010; Scurr et al., 2010; White et al., 2009)."
Introduction,"In addition, human Lpin1 polymorphisms have been associated with numerous metabolic traits including insulin and/or glucose levels (Suviolahti et al., 2006; Loos et al., 2007; Wiedmann et al., 2008), resting metabolic rate (Loos et al."
4 Discussion,"GM requires that the input to a neuron is highly variable, and it vanishes for a constant input current (Holt & Koch, 1997)."
DISCUSSION,"Thus, a role for glutamate and excitotoxicity in the direct mechanisms of ALS is appearing tenuous (Martin, 2010a), and the concept has so far failed to bear effective therapeutic fruit after more than 20 years (Rothstein et al., 1992)."
Methods,"Data on relative testes size were taken from an earlier review (Kappeler 1997a, eight species), gathered from the literature (nine species) and through personal communication with colleagues (six species)."
