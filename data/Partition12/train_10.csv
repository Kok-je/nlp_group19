,"1998), to provide great £exibility in testing evolutionary hypotheses (Huelsenbeck & Rannala 1997), and simply to give excellent results in the inference of evolutionary relationships (Kuhner & Felsenstein 1994; Huelsenbeck 1995). Constraints imposed by computational complexity are becoming less restrictive as computers improve. Given the recognition of phylogenetic inference as being inherently statistical in nature, it is surprising that so little attention has been paid to experimental design. A number of topics of relevance to experimental design in phylogenetics have been discussed previously. There is something of a folklore surrounding the choice of genes or other genomic regions for investigating particular evolutionary questions, but almost no published quantitative results. It is widely accepted that sequences that have undergone very little evolutionary change since their divergence from a common ancestor, through low substitution rates or short evolutionary times, will exhibit too few di¡erences to contain useful evolutionary information. Equally, sequences that have undergone very large amounts of change (high rates or long times) become `saturated' with changes and no evolutionary signal is detectable amid the noise. Consequently, a happy medium is expected at some intermediate level of sequence divergence, but the àsymptotic' results (for extreme high and low levels of divergence) give no clue as to where this lies. Although there is considerable experience with particular genes and organisms (see Hillis et al. (1996, pp. 336^339) for an extensive list of studies), where comparisons among genes have been made they tend to be evaluated empirically by the congruence of the results obtained among themselves and with researchers'a priori expectations. In addition, a large laboratory e¡ort is needed before even these qualitative conclusions can be reached. The methods introduced in this paper can quantify the e¡ects of varying levels of divergence. They con¢rm the belief that intermediate levels of sequence divergence are most useful, and are able to give estimates of optimal levels of divergence. The necessary analyses can be done before any data are collected. The only other method for assessing which genomic regions are likely to be most useful in phylogenetic questions is that of Yang (1998). This uses simulation to estimate probabilities of successful tree-topology inference. The approach may be extremely time-consuming for realistic problems. The choice of taxa to include in phylogenetic studies has also rarely been discussed. Li et al. (1987) considered the e¡ects of adding outgroup taxa, and Ritland & Clegg (1990) and Maddison et al. (1992) are agreed that if outgroups are to be added, they should not be too distantly related to the ingroup taxa (a conclusion that is con¢rmed in this paper)."

Introduction,"In a study that determined the response of the spine to sudden loads causing sagittal flexion, it was found that abdominal muscles rapidly responded to the sudden load with a large increase in muscle activation (Krajcarski et al., 1999). Also, Krajcarski et al. concluded that increases in EMG amplitudes of abdominal and trunk extensor muscles were determined predominantly by the added load magnitude and not the pre-loads. Chiang (in press) conducted a similar study with the difference being the trunk motion investigated was lateral bend instead of trunk flexion. Similar to Krajcarski et al. (1999), Chiang (in press) concluded that increased muscular activity due to pre-loads leads to increases in trunk muscle stiffness and spine stability. Krajcarski et al (1999) and Chiang (in press) have provided a greater understanding of the active muscular response that is responsible for maintaining stability."

 BNP concentration has been shown to be associated with the presence of a haemodynamically significant PDA in premature infants and to decrease to normal levels with ductal closure.33-36 In our study, which included older children with PDA, we found that patients with PDA and either a significant or a non-significant shunt always had significantly higher plasma BNP levels than all other groups (not only controls, but also patients with ASD and VSD)."

1. INTRODUCTION,"Whereas Lorden used crude upper bounds for the Type I error probability that are too conservative for practical applications, Bartroff and Lai (2008) overcome this difficulty by developing numerical methods to compute the Type I error probability and also extended the three-stage test to multiparameter and multi-armed settings, thus greatly broadening the scope of these efficient adaptive designs. A review of their method is given in Section 2.1. In Section 4 we prove the asymptotic optimality of these adaptive tests in the multiparameter case, extending Lorden’s (1983) result for the special case d = 1."

,"The real-world spaces that surround information users have been diversely called everything from personal information environments (Kwasnik, 1991; Malone, 1983) to personal information management (PIM) systems (Barreau, 1995) and personal spaces of information (Jones, 2007). Drawing upon interviews with academics, Lee (2003) proposes a model of three concentric zones of information that surround a user: “immediate,” within arm’s reach or a few footsteps away; “adjacent,” such as a nearby university library; and “outside,” such as a more distant bookstore. Speaking largely from an objectifying stance and adopting Lee’s concept of the “immediate information space,” this paper focuses on a visual research method—photography— that seems particularly well suited to learning more about settings and their accompanying information phenomena. A variety of investigative approaches may be used to study immediate information space. Jones (2007) suggests ethnography combined with design methodologies, and places emphasis on context and situation, including contextual inquiry (Beyer & Holtzblatt, 1998), situated activity (Suchman, 1983), and situated design (Greenbaum & Kyng, 1991)."
