,"In addition to the trophies and prizes, HBC members gain ‘ball status’ by moving up the ball status hierarchy, comprised of Statement, Star, Legend, and, ultimately Icon statuses, which are based on the number of years in the community, number of awards or trophies amassed, recognition within a particular category, and the number of balls participated in through the years (Galindo, 2013; personal communication with POSSE CAB). Competition can also be heightened through the use of ‘shade’ – backhanded remarks offered by judges or other ball participants (Galindo, 2013). In addition to the formal HBC, there is an emergent ‘Kiki’ or family scene that parallels the House structure but does not maintain the formal relationships that are maintained within the Houses. For example, the families can be formed without a particular House parent and the names are not linked to designers or House founders (i.e. Mafia, Foxx, Golden, Kardashian) (Alonzo Gibson, personal communication 8/14/2015). The family scene emerged as an attempt to reject the perceived rigidity of the Ball scene for up and coming participants. In particular, families formed as an opportunity to provide a safe space where youth could practice ‘vogueing’ and other ball competition skills without experiencing the shade or ‘chopping’ (being cut from the category by judges) that occurs during the competitions. Family scene members may move into the Houses as they get more skilled but they may also remain independent of the Houses and still participate in the balls. This new scene provides new opportunities for youth to become involved in the Ball scene without necessarily belonging to a particular House. The HBC thrives, in part, by serving as an in-group for youth who are so frequently excluded from acceptance within more dominant groups (Rowan et al., 2013). Additionally, the HBC provides both the much-needed acceptance and support that they lack in other contexts, and a safe outlet for expression, camaraderie, and fun. Therefore, although the HBC is a socially constructed space, it is one of few spaces in which Black GBT youth are able to fully embody their multiple identities in a safe space. For example, Kubicek, McNeeley, Holloway, Weiss, and Kipke (2013) observed the acceptance of gender and sexual fluidity of many of the House members and Ball participants."

Discussion,"25 (Carlson and Seamons 2008). Although this is a modest value, it does provide ample opportunity for natural selection to operate. The other condition – a selective differential – is clearly met. Hydropower development has profoundly changed freshwater environmental conditions experienced by Snake River fall Chinook salmon, so ample reason exists to believe that selective pressures for age at smolting could have changed as well. Our analyses suggest that the possibility of rapid evolutionary change in juvenile migration tactic within the last 50–60 years. Credence is lent to this hypothesis by research that has concluded that evolutionary changes have been experienced by introduced Chinook salmon populations over a 90-year period in New Zealand. There, Unwin et al. (2000) documented a divergence in juvenile migratory timing associated with differences in water temperatures that had affected juvenile growth, an association similar to that observed in Snake River fall Chinook salmon."

3.2. Yield and characterisation of ethanol organosolv lignin (EOL),"The efficient removal of lignin due to the prior steam pretreatment and the lower acid content of the cooking liquor likely limited the decrease in the molecular weight of the lignin in the pulping liquor which is typically observed during organosolv pretreatment (Pan et al., 2006a)."
REWIRING THE CIRCUIT – miR-21 AS AN ATTRACTIVE TARGET FOR THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION?,"Furthermore, the notion of targeting specific miRNA:mRNA interactions via morpholino technology may avoid the deleterious effects of broad inhibition of miR-21 (82) and more specific delivery technologies such as β-glucan microparticles, which hone specifically to macrophages could be utilized to limit the effects of inhibition to a specific target cell-type (83)."
DISCUSSION,[5] showed a 45% reduction in requirements for analgesics during the intraoperative period after clonidine premedication compared to standard premedication in patients undergoing bypass surgery.
Discussion,Gadolinium enhancement of the inflamed tissues is usually present with MRI.(15) The present case varied slightly in that the foreign body was isointense to hyperintense on precontrast T1-weighted images with the surrounding inflammatory reaction also being hyperintense to muscle.
DISCUSSION,"In a previous study (22), we reported that consumption of the alcohol-containing diet for a period of 2–3 mo impaired nitric oxide synthase-dependent dilatation of pial arterioles."
RESULTS,"lusitaniae in her stools and a positive mannan assay result (immunoenzyme assay, 500 pg/ml) (27, 28)."
Methods,"Whole mount in situ hybridization using digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes was performed as described [61]. cDNA probes used for in situ hybridization were as described previously: Brachyury [23], Foxa2/HNF3Œ≤ [26], Hesx1 [62], Lhx1 [27], Otx2 [28], and Bmp4 [29]."
1. Introduction,"Recent technological advances have also enabled precision deep-water surveys with both remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) [Ballard et al., 2000; Whitcomb et al., 2000; Singh et al., 2000] and Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) [e."
Results,"Nevertheless, β-arr2 dissociation from ICL3 precluded reliable determination of FLNA(16-23) binding kinetics to the β-arr2/ICL3 complex."
Discussion,"Interestingly, E2F-1 was specifically down-regulated in androgen-stimulated cells after paclitaxel administration; this result is consistent with observations of effective taxane treatment in head and neck cancers (43)."
Introduction,"Some Bacillus strains secrete significantly large amounts of alkaline proteases with good stability at higher pH and temperature values, which can be considered as compatible additives in laundry detergents [5–7, 14, 16, 17, 20, 27]."
Introduction,"Clinically, several studies have indicated that high IFP in the tumor is correlated with poor prognosis (15, 21, 22)."
Results and discussion,The inflection pressure of SA1 is 10 GPa lower than that of SiO2 glass (Murakami and Bass 2010) and 3 GPa lower than that of MgSiO3 glass (Murakami and Bass 2011).
INTRODUCTION,"Lastly, MA has been reduced using a signal processing technique known as ratiometry (25,26)."
METHODS,The C. elegans slow killing assay was conducted as described by Tan et al. (1999a) with minor modifications.
DISCUSSION,"Concerning the adaptation to HMs in plants, woody plants and herbaceous may possess similar physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying HM uptake, transport, sequestration, and detoxification (Luo et al., 2016)."
INTRODUCTION,"The mutant version of the tumor suppressor p53, which is mutated in 50% of cancers, drives invasion through enhanced Rab coupling protein (RCP)–dependent recycling of α5β1, the main receptor for FN, and several RTKs, EGFR, and Met (Caswell et al., 2008; Muller et al., 2013)."
Introduction,"Mitochondrial division is a complex process that is essential for survival in mammals (Nunnari and Suomalainen, 2012; Archer, 2014) and is facilitated by the actin cytoskeleton (De Vos et al., 2005; DuBoff et al., 2012; Korobova et al., 2013, 2014; Hatch et al., 2014; Li et al., 2015)."
Method,"Many techniques for bone defatting are described in the literature, including mechanical cleaning with water or air jet,(8) acetone ⁄ ethanol solution,(9) enzyme detergents,(8) hydrogen peroxide,(11) aqueous sodium hydroxide,(12) and sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl).(8,13) We adopted the latter technique, because it has been found suitable for formalinized specimens,(7) is safe for personnel and is very low cost."
Introduction,"However, the relationships between those polymorphisms and susceptibility to AS remain unclear; some studies on association between PD-1, CTLA-4 polymorphisms and AS risk had used comparatively small samples [17–24], and the results about the role of PD-1 or CTLA-4 gene polymorphisms in AS patients are inconsistent and inconclusive."
1 Introduction,"Intuitively this is done by using packed secret-sharing [16], where several values are packed and then shared in a single instance of secret-sharing."
4 Discussion,"The FE model predicted that the piston stapes prosthesis implantation would affect the RW membrane displacements, which is consistent with the experimental data reported by Wysocki et al. (2011) and Stenfelt et al. (2004b)."
