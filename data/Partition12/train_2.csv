DISCUSSION,"Although there is limited evidence concerning the role of PPAR-Œ± on memory and cognition, our results are in line with previous studies showing that systemic administrations of OEA, URB597, or WY14643 (a PPAR-Œ± agonist) facilitate learning processes and enhance retention of inhibitory avoidance task through activation of PPAR-Œ± (Campolongo et al., 2009a; Mazzola et al., 2009)."

Discussion,"IL-10 is also considered to be an anti-inflammatory cytokine, but in contrast to most anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 concentrations increases during endurance exercise in thermoneutral conditions (Nieman et al. 2012; Peake et al. 2005, 2008; Svendsen et al. 2014) and increases further when exercise is conducted in a hot laboratory environment (Peake et al."
2.3.2. Topic model,Griffiths et al. (2007) demonstrate that the Topic model outperforms LSA in predicting word association and several other semantic phenomena.
Discussion,"In addition, our results seem to support the previous studies‚Äô results that both training programs produced statistical significance on functional outcomes.[33-37]"
Methods,"Protein concentrations were determined using the DC‚Ñ¢ protein assay following the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions with bovine serum albumin as standard (Bio-Rad, Mississauga, Ontario) [21]."
2.2.4. Model validation,"…in the tree-cover product was selected with the assumption that pixels with at least 10% tree cover have the potential to be classified as forest under natural conditions, in order to account for the deforestation that has occurred during the last decades (Liu et al., 2001; Viña et al., 2007)."
4. Discussion,"This constitutes an improvement over previous synoptic giant panda habitat evaluations in which the presence of understory bamboo was ignored (Liu et al., 2001; Loucks et al., 2003; Viña et al., 2007) due to the difficulty in isolating its signal from that of overstory canopy (Linderman et al.,…"

1 Introduction,"My results give one way to interpret the empirical evidence from Baker et al. (2012) that suggests that fiscal policy uncertainty has been an important force behind the fall in consumption, investment, and output that we have seen during the Great Recession. In addition, my model is consistent with the relatively small effects reported by Fernández-Villaverde et al. (2012b) and Born and Pfeifer (2011) since both studies do not consider the impact of the ZLB."
Discussion,"The participants tested in the present study were comparable to similar groups of older men tested in our laboratory; the sVO2p values in the full step (44 ± 11 s), which are greater than those generally reported for healthy younger adults (*20–30 s) (DeLorey et al. 2004; Gurd et al. 2006, 2008; Murias et al. 2010), are similar to pretraining values recently reported (43 ± 11 s) by Murias et al.
