Introduction,Cultural and socioeconomic factors when taken into consideration might also have an impact of the patient-treatment interaction and subsequently the overall response to therapy [10].
Methodology,"(1996, p. 499) Kitzinger (1994, 1995) argues that interaction is the crucial feature of focus groups because the interaction between participants highlights their view of the world, the language they use about an issue and their values and beliefs about a situation."
,"br A recent work (Bhuiyan et al., 2004) in the SCNT bovine field demonstrated that transfected ear fibroblasts were less able to develop to the blastocyst stage than their non-transfected counterpart, regardless of passage number (early or late). More likely, discrepancies among results reported up to now are due to differences in vector type, transfection protocols (Bhuiyan et al., 2004), NT methods and donor cell culture conditions (Wells et al., 2003; Miyoshi et al., 2003). Furthermore, the site of gene(s) integration(s), the transgene used and its possible interference in endogenous gene expression could influence results (Hodges and Stice, 2003). Another aspect to consider is donor cell lines and genotypes, since Heyman et al. (2002) found that four different subcultures isolated from a single skin biopsy resulted in significantly different NT blastocyst rates (ranging from 5 to 30%), and Kühholzer et al. (2001) even found different morula and blastocyst rates among clonal colonies obtained from the same donor cell fetus. In our investigation of in vivo developmental capacity after transfer of NT embryos to recipient cows, we did not observe significant differences in initial pregnancy (< day 40 of gestation) rates between transfected and non-transfected donor cells, which was also reported by Zakhartchenko et al. (2001). In contrast, Forsberg et al. (2002) reported lower rates of initial pregnancy for NT of transfected cells than for NT of non-transfected cells. In our study, the small number of recipients carrying transgenic and non-transgenic cloned embryos precludes a conclusive result concerning embryo survival to term. Nevertheless, we suggest that to some extent transfection procedures negatively affect fetal viability, since non-transgenic pregnancies were miscarried during the first trimester of gestation, though one initial TFCE pregnancy (44 days of gestation) was interrupted. On the other hand, two pregnancies of the FCE group were carried to term. This is supported by the findings of Zakhartchenko et al. (2001) and Brophy et al. (2003) who observed a lower pregnancy rate (> day 30 of gestation) and a lower proportion of viable calves at weaning for NT using transfected cells than for their non-transfected counterpart."

,"They initialize their orthogonal mapping using an adversarial training phase, much like Conneau et al. [2018], and solve the optimization problem with alternating minimization. Our approach differs from theirs: by bootstrapping on the solution of a smaller problem to initialize the mapping, we avoid the need for a neural network initialization that is used in their approach. In addition, our annealing scheme on the entropic regularization leads to smooth convergence, with very little sensitivity to initialization. Concurrently with our work,1 Grave et al.

Summary of Limitations and Barriers to Diagnosis and Treatment of OSSN in Africa,"[6,7] This is a challenge because of the long distances to travel for consultations, and thus patients are unlikely to come back for treatment for something like OSSN unless it is in its advanced stages significantly impacting their quality of life, at which point early interventions are no longer possible.[6,8] A 2010 study in Tanzania showed that 40% of operated suspected OSSN cases were managed outside of major hospitals where better facilities and quality of care was available, because of difficulty of traveling to and accessing these centers."
Introduction,"Although all three species are relevant for primate conservation plans, Udzungwa red colobus is of particular interest; it is found only in the remaining forest fragments within and around the Udzungwa Mountains, it is listed as endangered (IUCN 2013), and is very sensitive to environmental changes and hunting (Marshall 2007; Marshall et al. 2010; Rovero and Struhsaker 2007; Rovero et al. 2012; Struhsaker 2010)."

Discussion,"The effort to develop new treatments for ALS has led to repeated failure since the demonstration that riluzole extended survival.[3] Despite initially encouraging results from a Phase II trial, which suggested beneficial effects on ALSFRS-R and survival,[27] the recent negative results of the dexpramipexole Phase III study is yet another disappointing example."
Discussion,"This finding corresponds well with the results of Askaer et al. (2011); Couwenberg et al. (2011); Schäfer et al. (2012) and Audet et al. (2013b), who all reported negligible CH4 emissions when GWL was 20–30 cm below the soil surface, which is attributed to a restricted methane production zone and…"

1 Introduction,", 2009; Dedrick et al., 2010) have received a great deal of attention. Xing and Detert (2010) examined the case of the iPhone and found that China just contributed only 3.6% of $2.0 billion export to the US, the rest was simply a transfer from Germany, Japan, Korea, the US, and other countries. These studies rely on “tear down” analyses that assign the value of individual components to source companies and their countries. These firm- and product-based case studies can provide intuitive images of GVCs in terms of the activities of multinational enterprises. However, when we examine the Chinese economy’s role in global production networks as a whole, its share of total value added through the export of final products to the United States was actually about 75% in 2005 (Meng et al., 2011). This indicates that the “tear down” case studies focus on only the supply chain of a specific firm and particular products, and are clearly not representative of the broader role of China’s domestic production networks and inter-industrial linkages in the whole value creation process. Other work on this topic shows that domestic value added can vary substantially between different economic sectors (see Koopman et al. (forthcoming 2013), Erumban et al. (2011), Stehrer (2012), and OECD-WTO (2013)."

INTRODUCTION,"A recent storytelling task by Hendriks et al. (2014) confirmed this overall pattern but also highlighted that other factors can modulate this effect of the discourse stages. In the task used by Hendriks et al. (2014), participants were asked to tell picturebased stories featuring two characters of the same gender to a hypothetical listener. The six pictures of each story were shown one at a time. The first and second pictures displayed the first character only. A second character entered the story in the third picture, and in the fourth and fifth pictures he performed an action. The final picture showed again the first character alone. Hendriks et al. (2014) analyzed the references to the two characters at five positions in the story: Introduction and maintaining of first character, introduction and maintaining of second character, and re-introduction of first character1."

,"The term lesser known species does not imply that the species are unknown, but rather they presently constitute the bulk of wood that finds no economic use (Barany et al. 2003). Hansom (1983) and ITTO (2007) described lesser-known species as those species for which current commercial demand is below their forest production potentials. Freezaillah (1984) also defined an LKS as a commercially less accepted species left in the forest after a logging operation."
