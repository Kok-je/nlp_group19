,"These properties have been noticed by others who used ̂κ in place of ̂ (Friedman 1989; Brown et al. 1999), and they can be exploited to reduce the computation time for regularized discriminant analysis in high-dimensional settings (Hastie and Tibshirani 2004). • R̂λ can be calculated by multiplying all off-diagonal elements of R̂ by λ. • The proposed regularization will reduce the bias inherent in eigenvalues of sample correlation matrices (Friedman 1989), provided that a reasonable choice of regularization parameter λ is used. Bias generally will not be completely removed. • R̂λ manages a bias–variance trade-off; R̂ has potentially high variance but relatively little bias (being asymptotically unbiased for large N , fixed p), and I has no variance, but is biased for R in general. Thus, loosely speaking, R̂λ can be thought of as a weighted average of a variance term and a bias term, and we aim to choose λ to optimize this bias–variance trade-off. Ledoit and Wolf (2004) previously made this point for ̂κ ."

,"1998), to provide great £exibility in testing evolutionary hypotheses (Huelsenbeck & Rannala 1997), and simply to give excellent results in the inference of evolutionary relationships (Kuhner & Felsenstein 1994; Huelsenbeck 1995). Constraints imposed by computational complexity are becoming less restrictive as computers improve. Given the recognition of phylogenetic inference as being inherently statistical in nature, it is surprising that so little attention has been paid to experimental design. A number of topics of relevance to experimental design in phylogenetics have been discussed previously. There is something of a folklore surrounding the choice of genes or other genomic regions for investigating particular evolutionary questions, but almost no published quantitative results. It is widely accepted that sequences that have undergone very little evolutionary change since their divergence from a common ancestor, through low substitution rates or short evolutionary times, will exhibit too few di¡erences to contain useful evolutionary information. Equally, sequences that have undergone very large amounts of change (high rates or long times) become `saturated' with changes and no evolutionary signal is detectable amid the noise. Consequently, a happy medium is expected at some intermediate level of sequence divergence, but the àsymptotic' results (for extreme high and low levels of divergence) give no clue as to where this lies. Although there is considerable experience with particular genes and organisms (see Hillis et al. (1996, pp. 336^339) for an extensive list of studies), where comparisons among genes have been made they tend to be evaluated empirically by the congruence of the results obtained among themselves and with researchers'a priori expectations. In addition, a large laboratory e¡ort is needed before even these qualitative conclusions can be reached. The methods introduced in this paper can quantify the e¡ects of varying levels of divergence. They con¢rm the belief that intermediate levels of sequence divergence are most useful, and are able to give estimates of optimal levels of divergence. The necessary analyses can be done before any data are collected. The only other method for assessing which genomic regions are likely to be most useful in phylogenetic questions is that of Yang (1998). This uses simulation to estimate probabilities of successful tree-topology inference. The approach may be extremely time-consuming for realistic problems. The choice of taxa to include in phylogenetic studies has also rarely been discussed. Li et al. (1987) considered the e¡ects of adding outgroup taxa, and Ritland & Clegg (1990) and Maddison et al. (1992) are agreed that if outgroups are to be added, they should not be too distantly related to the ingroup taxa (a conclusion that is con¢rmed in this paper)."

,"[6] and Albal et al. [9, lo] found no influence of the pressure on the volumetric liquid-phase mass transfer coefficient and on the interfacial area, while Sridhar and Potter [ 11, 121 report an increase in the interfacial area of as much as 75% for a pressure increase from 0.1 to 1.1 MPa. The contradictory results of the above-mentioned authors can lead to considerable miscalculations, whatever correlation is taken. In this paper all major studies on the influence of pressure on mass transfer phenomena in gas-liquid systems and reactors are reviewed critically. Points of agreement and conflict are indicated and discussed in order to improve understanding of the mass transfer 0255-2701/89/%3.50 Chem. Eng.
