,"br A recent work (Bhuiyan et al., 2004) in the SCNT bovine field demonstrated that transfected ear fibroblasts were less able to develop to the blastocyst stage than their non-transfected counterpart, regardless of passage number (early or late). More likely, discrepancies among results reported up to now are due to differences in vector type, transfection protocols (Bhuiyan et al., 2004), NT methods and donor cell culture conditions (Wells et al., 2003; Miyoshi et al., 2003). Furthermore, the site of gene(s) integration(s), the transgene used and its possible interference in endogenous gene expression could influence results (Hodges and Stice, 2003). Another aspect to consider is donor cell lines and genotypes, since Heyman et al. (2002) found that four different subcultures isolated from a single skin biopsy resulted in significantly different NT blastocyst rates (ranging from 5 to 30%), and Kühholzer et al."

,"br A recent work (Bhuiyan et al., 2004) in the SCNT bovine field demonstrated that transfected ear fibroblasts were less able to develop to the blastocyst stage than their non-transfected counterpart, regardless of passage number (early or late). More likely, discrepancies among results reported up to now are due to differences in vector type, transfection protocols (Bhuiyan et al., 2004), NT methods and donor cell culture conditions (Wells et al., 2003; Miyoshi et al., 2003). Furthermore, the site of gene(s) integration(s), the transgene used and its possible interference in endogenous gene expression could influence results (Hodges and Stice, 2003). Another aspect to consider is donor cell lines and genotypes, since Heyman et al. (2002) found that four different subcultures isolated from a single skin biopsy resulted in significantly different NT blastocyst rates (ranging from 5 to 30%), and Kühholzer et al. (2001) even found different morula and blastocyst rates among clonal colonies obtained from the same donor cell fetus. In our investigation of in vivo developmental capacity after transfer of NT embryos to recipient cows, we did not observe significant differences in initial pregnancy (< day 40 of gestation) rates between transfected and non-transfected donor cells, which was also reported by Zakhartchenko et al. (2001). In contrast, Forsberg et al. (2002) reported lower rates of initial pregnancy for NT of transfected cells than for NT of non-transfected cells."

5.2 Stability of the selection trait,"Consequently, on the basis of these findings, the difference in thigmotaxis between the selectively bred HOFT and LOFT mice seemed to be a stable and robust feature of these animals, suggesting that the two lines differed with regard to trait anxiety rather than to state anxiety (see Belzung & Griebel, 2001; Lister, 1990)."

Using the latter method, the local mass transfer distribution can also be determined and related to the heat transfer by the analogy between mass and heat transfer (e.g. Han and Goldstein (2008)) and applied for discrete hole film cooling as well."

,"Whereas Lorden used crude upper bounds for the Type I error probability that are too conservative for practical applications, Bartroff and Lai (2008) overcome this difficulty by developing numerical methods to compute the Type I error probability and also extended the three-stage test to multiparameter and multi-armed settings, thus greatly broadening the scope of these efficient adaptive designs. A review of their method is given in Section 2.1. In Section 4 we prove the asymptotic optimality of these adaptive tests in the multiparameter case, extending Lorden’s (1983) result for the special case d = 1. Another new addition to this asymptotic optimality theory of adaptive designs is related to the problem of trial extension considered in Section 2.2. As pointed out by Cui et al. (1999), the issue of increasing the maximum sample size sometimes arises after interim analysis in group sequential trials."
