,"They initialize their orthogonal mapping using an adversarial training phase, much like Conneau et al. [2018], and solve the optimization problem with alternating minimization. Our approach differs from theirs: by bootstrapping on the solution of a smaller problem to initialize the mapping, we avoid the need for a neural network initialization that is used in their approach. In addition, our annealing scheme on the entropic regularization leads to smooth convergence, with very little sensitivity to initialization. Concurrently with our work,1 Grave et al. [2018] tackle the problem of unsupervised word embedding alignment with a similar optimization framework as the one proposed by Zhang et al. [2017b], combining Wasserstein distances (an instance of optimal transport distances) and Procrustes alignment. Their approach differs from Zhang et al. [2017b] in how they scale up optimization, by relying on a stochastic Sinkhorn solver [Genevay et al., 2018]. In addition, they initialize their approach by solving a convex relaxation of the the original problem. Although driven by a similar motivation (word embedding alignment) and relying on similar principles (joint optimization of optimal transport coupling and feature mapping) as the work of Zhang et al. [2017b] and Grave et al. [2018], our approach differs from them in several aspects."

INTRODUCTION,"The reciprocating single file systems such as Reciproc (VDW, Munich, Germany) and WaveOne (Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) provides more flexibility of the M‐wire Ni‐Ti alloy, greater resistance to cyclic fatigue and better handling of narrow and curved canals than the traditional Ni‐Ti instruments and they are widely used in endodontic treatment.[17,18] These file systems use reciprocating movements in the preparation of root canals."

DISCUSSION,"It has been reported that NF-κB activation can induce expression of Bcl-2 protein, thereby inhibit apoptosis.((33)) However, our results documented that HQH could attenuate adriamycin-induced cellular apoptosis, while NF-κB signaling was inhibited."
DISCUSSION,"[24,25] However, planar I-131 imaging has traditionally suffered from low resolution, and a paucity of anatomic information along with a long list of physiologic variants makes image interpretation challenging.[26] Therefore, it is assumed that the reason why functioning ETT in TGDR has been underestimated in patients with DTC is mainly due to the poor image quality of an I‐131 scan."

There were no statistically significant differences in IL-6 and IL-8 gene polymorphisms between the SLE and control groups (p=0.53 and p=0.44, respectively). In addition, there was no significant association between the two groups in allelic frequency of IL-6 and IL-8 (p=0.89 and p=0.26, respectively). Also, Schotte et al. (2001) studied a population-based case–control study of 211 Caucasian German SLE patients and did not reveal any significant association of IL-6 gene polymorphism with susceptibility to SLE."
