,"Identity begins to take shape during adolescence, but, with the incorporation of new life experiences, is continually modified throughout adulthood (McLean, 2008). Theories of identity maintain that individuals engage in particular actions to confirm their own identities and that social role expectations are internalized and demonstrated through behavior (Stryker & Burke, 2000). Most historical models of adult development that are discussed in the literature are based on research with all-male subjects or were written from a male vantage point (Caffarella & Olson, 1993). Factors that most meaningfully impact the identities of older women are unacknowledged in these models (Price, 1998).

,"multiple equilibria, see Albanesi et al. (2003), King and Wolman (2004) and Blake and Kirsanova (2012), and a simple New Keynesian model is not appropriate to investigate many consequences of policy delegation. As there is no particular reason to assume one equilibrium will prevail any more than another, even if the delegation schemes behave locally as intuition might suggest globally could be a different matter. The central questions addressed in this paper follow on from this. How do delegation schemes affect the likelihood of obtaining multiple equilibria in more realistic models? If multiplicity survives, how should we quantify the welfare implications of choosing one of these delegation schemes? Can any of these schemes affect the likelihood that economic agents successfully coordinate on the best equilibrium? To address these questions we study a version of the familiar sticky price model modified to incorporate capital accumulation (Sveen and Weinke, 2005; Woodford, 2005). This model contains all the features as at the heart of many DSGE models used in policy analysis which makes it a ‘representative agent’ for our policy analysis. Moreover, we choose a set up which encompasses the ‘worst case’ scenario: there are expectation traps and economic agents may be more likely to coordinate on the worst equilibrium (Dennis and Kirsanova, 2012). We confirm the previous results that all these delegation schemes can improve social welfare, but we show that they only unequivocally improve welfare if the economy remains in the best equilibrium. At the same time, we demonstrate that none of the considered delegation schemes eliminates expectation traps, moreover, new equilibria arise under delegation. Whether there is a gain associated with a transition to a delegation scheme will depend on which equilibrium under the original unmodified objective one starts from and to which equilibrium one transitions. More encouragingly, all delegation schemes reduce the range of parameters which ensure the unique worst equilibrium, thus increasing the likelihood of coordinating on the Pareto-preferred equilibrium. We also argue that a delegation scheme can change the way how agents coordinate on an equilibrium. In particular, we show that price level targeting increases the likelihood that the best equilibrium realizes. The paper is organized as follows. In the next section we outline the model and discuss the calibration. Section 3 recapitulates the analysis in Blake and Kirsanova (2012) for our sticky-price model with capital, showing how multiplicity arises when monetary policy is conducted under discretion and with an unmodified monetary policy objective."

,"Peña and Brody (2014) demonstrated that both reactions mainly occur when deviant posts are perceived as reflecting negatively on their recipient. These authors further argue that through hiding and unfriending the deviate, recipients of deviant messages strive to distance themselves from the deviate.

DISCUSSION,"This result is in agreement with the findings that mouse embryos homozygous for a null goosecoid allele do not have gastrulation or neural induction defects (Yamada et al., 1995; Rivera-Perez et al., 1995) and chick embryos can develop normally even when manipulated so that their organizer does not express goosecoid(Psychoyos and Stern, 1996)."
Clinical features,The anatomic site of involvement was determined by the system reported by Knowles et al..[18] We specified lachrymal gland origin when the gland structure could be clearly recognized in the histopathological specimens.
Results & Discussion,"A comparison between the findings of Krajcarski et al. (1999) and the rested values in the present study revealed similar effects of pre- load and added load on peak trunk flexion and extensor moments. The EMG activity of the trunk extensor muscles (TES and LES) had similar responses to the loading conditions, although the pre-trial LES and TES EMG amplitudes from Krajcarski et al. (1999) were about 6 to 13 %MVC larger than was found in the current study."
Discussion,"Other than the transfer sometime after 50,000 years ago of the Yamuna River from the Indus to the Ganges (Clift et al. 2012), the timing of specific capture events cannot be reconstructed from the terrestrial evidence alone and in many cases remains unclear or imprecise (Clift and Blusztajn 2005)."

Introduction,Cultural and socioeconomic factors when taken into consideration might also have an impact of the patient-treatment interaction and subsequently the overall response to therapy [10].
Methodology,"(1996, p. 499) Kitzinger (1994, 1995) argues that interaction is the crucial feature of focus groups because the interaction between participants highlights their view of the world, the language they use about an issue and their values and beliefs about a situation."
,"br A recent work (Bhuiyan et al., 2004) in the SCNT bovine field demonstrated that transfected ear fibroblasts were less able to develop to the blastocyst stage than their non-transfected counterpart, regardless of passage number (early or late). More likely, discrepancies among results reported up to now are due to differences in vector type, transfection protocols (Bhuiyan et al., 2004), NT methods and donor cell culture conditions (Wells et al., 2003; Miyoshi et al., 2003). Furthermore, the site of gene(s) integration(s), the transgene used and its possible interference in endogenous gene expression could influence results (Hodges and Stice, 2003). Another aspect to consider is donor cell lines and genotypes, since Heyman et al. (2002) found that four different subcultures isolated from a single skin biopsy resulted in significantly different NT blastocyst rates (ranging from 5 to 30%), and Kühholzer et al. (2001) even found different morula and blastocyst rates among clonal colonies obtained from the same donor cell fetus. In our investigation of in vivo developmental capacity after transfer of NT embryos to recipient cows, we did not observe significant differences in initial pregnancy (< day 40 of gestation) rates between transfected and non-transfected donor cells, which was also reported by Zakhartchenko et al. (2001). In contrast, Forsberg et al. (2002) reported lower rates of initial pregnancy for NT of transfected cells than for NT of non-transfected cells. In our study, the small number of recipients carrying transgenic and non-transgenic cloned embryos precludes a conclusive result concerning embryo survival to term. Nevertheless, we suggest that to some extent transfection procedures negatively affect fetal viability, since non-transgenic pregnancies were miscarried during the first trimester of gestation, though one initial TFCE pregnancy (44 days of gestation) was interrupted. On the other hand, two pregnancies of the FCE group were carried to term. This is supported by the findings of Zakhartchenko et al. (2001) and Brophy et al. (2003) who observed a lower pregnancy rate (> day 30 of gestation) and a lower proportion of viable calves at weaning for NT using transfected cells than for their non-transfected counterpart."
2.3. Analytical techniques,DGS composition was determined by the method described by Kim et al. (2008a).
Changes in CO2 and O3 Effects Through Time,"It appears that the initial stimulation of growth by elevated CO2 allows forests to more quickly reach the point in stand development where environmental factors (light, water, nutrients, and so on) limit canopy production, but eventually, trees growing under ambient conditions reach a similar set of limitations to growth (Körner 2006)."
