,"The real-world spaces that surround information users have been diversely called everything from personal information environments (Kwasnik, 1991; Malone, 1983) to personal information management (PIM) systems (Barreau, 1995) and personal spaces of information (Jones, 2007). Drawing upon interviews with academics, Lee (2003) proposes a model of three concentric zones of information that surround a user: “immediate,” within arm’s reach or a few footsteps away; “adjacent,” such as a nearby university library; and “outside,” such as a more distant bookstore. Speaking largely from an objectifying stance and adopting Lee’s concept of the “immediate information space,” this paper focuses on a visual research method—photography— that seems particularly well suited to learning more about settings and their accompanying information phenomena. A variety of investigative approaches may be used to study immediate information space. Jones (2007) suggests ethnography combined with design methodologies, and places emphasis on context and situation, including contextual inquiry (Beyer & Holtzblatt, 1998), situated activity (Suchman, 1983), and situated design (Greenbaum & Kyng, 1991). Naumer and Fisher (2007) recommend naturalistic inquiry (Lincoln & Guba, 1985) and the data-gathering methods of unobtrusive observation, interviews, diaries, text analysis, pictures, and videos."

2.3 Funding costs and other BHC traits,"As argued by Demirgüç-Kunt and Huizinga (2004), Total cost of funds is an implicit interest rate on BHC liabilities, which is inferred from its financial statements. While Total cost of funds measures the overall cost of a BHC’s debts, it can differ across banks and time due to differences in interest rates or in the maturity and structure of a BHC’s debt. We therefore construct a second funding cost measure that focuses only on deposits. Following Gilje, Loutskina, and Strahan (2016), we measure the cost of deposits as a BHC’s interest expense on domestic deposits during a quarter divided by the stock of domestic deposits at the beginning of the quarter (Cost of domestic deposits)."
