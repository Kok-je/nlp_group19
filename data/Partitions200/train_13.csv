INTRODUCTION,"The right maxilla of Bahinia preserves the morphology of the snout and an integral segment of the orbit (Kay et al. 2004: Figure 8). The specimen is full of cracks and has probably suffered some distortion via bilateral compression and displacement of fragments high up between the orbit and nasal aperture. nevertheless, it appears to preserve a faithful approximation of the shape of the lateral aspect of the face, especially in the maxillary region between toothrow and orbit. The segment of the inferior orbital margin that Kay et al. (2004) used as a basis for judging orbit size remains fairly intact."
