,", 2012; Bergen et al., 2012) but also for studying children’s pragmatic abilities without implicitly assuming they have mastered challenging linguistic structures (Stiller et al., 2011). In this paper, we extend these results beyond simple reference games to full decision-problems in which the agents reason about language and action together over time. To do this, we use the Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP) to implement agents that are capable of manipulating the multiply-nested belief structures required for implicature calculation. Optimal decision making in Dec-POMDPs is NEXP complete, so we employ the single-agent POMDP approximation of Vogel et al. (2013). We show that agents in the Dec-POMDP reach implicature-rich interpretations simply as a byproduct of the way they reason about each other to maximize joint utility."

Introduction,"Dizzinesslightheadedness (Jansen and Lipsitz 1995) or sleepiness (Vloet et al. 2005) is the most frequent clinical presentation; however, severe PPH has also been associated with syncope (Lipsitz et al. 1986) and falls (Puisieux et al. 2000; Le Couteur et al. 2003)."
Methods,"When the outcome of the literature review was deemed not to qualify for inclusion (e.g., study size too small for stable age-specific counts, or reports focusing on mortality rather than incidence of CJD), the required agespecific incidence counts for 5-year age groups (cases and, sometimes, person-year denominators) were obtained upon request from three sources: firstly from authors reporting ALS incidence on the basis of National Registry data in Sweden [17,18]; secondly, from the Research and Surveillance Unit at the Edinburgh Unit (RGWill) for atCJD and vCJD in the UK, for the period 1993–2007; and thirdly, from the Spanish CJD Registry 1995–2013 for gCJD, sCJD and sRPNDd (Table 2)."
4. Discussion,"The masses presented in Table 3 are averages for several specimens, but in this analysis Arctodus simus is represented by the specimen PM 24880, one of the largest and most complete specimens known (Richards & Turnbull 1995). If one takes the average value of the six means calculated for this particular animal from the total sample, the result is a mass of 780 kg, very close to the 766 kg calculated for the specimen by Richards and Turnbull (1995). The corresponding values for the regressions for felids and ursids are 822, and no less than 1 039 kg, respectively."

1. Introduction,The goal in our ISCA 2012 paper [66] is to mitigate such detrimental e ects of bank con icts in a cost-e ective manner.
,"br A recent work (Bhuiyan et al., 2004) in the SCNT bovine field demonstrated that transfected ear fibroblasts were less able to develop to the blastocyst stage than their non-transfected counterpart, regardless of passage number (early or late). More likely, discrepancies among results reported up to now are due to differences in vector type, transfection protocols (Bhuiyan et al., 2004), NT methods and donor cell culture conditions (Wells et al., 2003; Miyoshi et al., 2003). Furthermore, the site of gene(s) integration(s), the transgene used and its possible interference in endogenous gene expression could influence results (Hodges and Stice, 2003). Another aspect to consider is donor cell lines and genotypes, since Heyman et al. (2002) found that four different subcultures isolated from a single skin biopsy resulted in significantly different NT blastocyst rates (ranging from 5 to 30%), and Kühholzer et al. (2001) even found different morula and blastocyst rates among clonal colonies obtained from the same donor cell fetus. In our investigation of in vivo developmental capacity after transfer of NT embryos to recipient cows, we did not observe significant differences in initial pregnancy (< day 40 of gestation) rates between transfected and non-transfected donor cells, which was also reported by Zakhartchenko et al. (2001). In contrast, Forsberg et al."
7.3. Orographic Precipitation,"…power incision rule, however, demonstrates that the increase in erosivity that might accompany greater precipitation along the front would be accompanied by a reduction in channel gradient [e.g., Roe et al., 2002; Whipple et al., 1999], as the river is more effective at balancing rock uplift."
