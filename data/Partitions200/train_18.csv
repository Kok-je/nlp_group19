,"Identity begins to take shape during adolescence, but, with the incorporation of new life experiences, is continually modified throughout adulthood (McLean, 2008). Theories of identity maintain that individuals engage in particular actions to confirm their own identities and that social role expectations are internalized and demonstrated through behavior (Stryker & Burke, 2000). Most historical models of adult development that are discussed in the literature are based on research with all-male subjects or were written from a male vantage point (Caffarella & Olson, 1993). Factors that most meaningfully impact the identities of older women are unacknowledged in these models (Price, 1998).
