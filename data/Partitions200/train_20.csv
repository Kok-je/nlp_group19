,"Peña and Brody (2014) demonstrated that both reactions mainly occur when deviant posts are perceived as reflecting negatively on their recipient. These authors further argue that through hiding and unfriending the deviate, recipients of deviant messages strive to distance themselves from the deviate. Thereby, they seek to reduce the negative effects the behavior has on them. Similarly, research on group schisms has shown that identity subversion as an outcome of norm-deviant behavior motivates group members to distance themselves from the behavior by leaving the group (e.g., Sani & Todman, 2002). In their recent literature review, Nicholls and Rice (2017) outline several additional reactions to online deviance."

(1999) and the rested values in the present study revealed similar effects of pre- load and added load on peak trunk flexion and extensor moments. The EMG activity of the trunk extensor muscles (TES and LES) had similar responses to the loading conditions, although the pre-trial LES and TES EMG amplitudes from Krajcarski et al. (1999) were about 6 to 13 %MVC larger than was found in the current study."
Discussion,"Other than the transfer sometime after 50,000 years ago of the Yamuna River from the Indus to the Ganges (Clift et al. 2012), the timing of specific capture events cannot be reconstructed from the terrestrial evidence alone and in many cases remains unclear or imprecise (Clift and Blusztajn 2005)."

Introduction,Cultural and socioeconomic factors when taken into consideration might also have an impact of the patient-treatment interaction and subsequently the overall response to therapy [10].
Methodology,"(1996, p. 499) Kitzinger (1994, 1995) argues that interaction is the crucial feature of focus groups because the interaction between participants highlights their view of the world, the language they use about an issue and their values and beliefs about a situation."
,"br A recent work (Bhuiyan et al., 2004) in the SCNT bovine field demonstrated that transfected ear fibroblasts were less able to develop to the blastocyst stage than their non-transfected counterpart, regardless of passage number (early or late). More likely, discrepancies among results reported up to now are due to differences in vector type, transfection protocols (Bhuiyan et al., 2004), NT methods and donor cell culture conditions (Wells et al., 2003; Miyoshi et al., 2003). Furthermore, the site of gene(s) integration(s), the transgene used and its possible interference in endogenous gene expression could influence results (Hodges and Stice, 2003). Another aspect to consider is donor cell lines and genotypes, since Heyman et al. (2002) found that four different subcultures isolated from a single skin biopsy resulted in significantly different NT blastocyst rates (ranging from 5 to 30%), and Kühholzer et al. (2001) even found different morula and blastocyst rates among clonal colonies obtained from the same donor cell fetus. In our investigation of in vivo developmental capacity after transfer of NT embryos to recipient cows, we did not observe significant differences in initial pregnancy (< day 40 of gestation) rates between transfected and non-transfected donor cells, which was also reported by Zakhartchenko et al. (2001). In contrast, Forsberg et al. (2002) reported lower rates of initial pregnancy for NT of transfected cells than for NT of non-transfected cells. In our study, the small number of recipients carrying transgenic and non-transgenic cloned embryos precludes a conclusive result concerning embryo survival to term. Nevertheless, we suggest that to some extent transfection procedures negatively affect fetal viability, since non-transgenic pregnancies were miscarried during the first trimester of gestation, though one initial TFCE pregnancy (44 days of gestation) was interrupted. On the other hand, two pregnancies of the FCE group were carried to term. This is supported by the findings of Zakhartchenko et al. (2001) and Brophy et al. (2003) who observed a lower pregnancy rate (> day 30 of gestation) and a lower proportion of viable calves at weaning for NT using transfected cells than for their non-transfected counterpart."

Changes in CO2 and O3 Effects Through Time,"It appears that the initial stimulation of growth by elevated CO2 allows forests to more quickly reach the point in stand development where environmental factors (light, water, nutrients, and so on) limit canopy production, but eventually, trees growing under ambient conditions reach a similar set of limitations to growth (Körner 2006)."

DISCUSSION,"In addition, bone marrow transplant retinopathy can mimic radiation retinopathy, and it is not possible to distinguish the 2 retinopathies unless affected patients have a history of exposure to one (eg, radiation) and not the other (eg, bone marrow transplantation); the same predicament occurs with the coexistence of diabetic retinopathy and radiation retinopathy.(8) Diseases and treatment complications that mimic radiation retinopathy may be additive, with resultant worse radiation retinopathy than would have been the case without the systemic disease (eg, diabetes mellitus) or treatment (eg, chemotherapy)."

,Ligation of SIRPα by CD47 is thought to promote the tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic region of SIRPα.(20) We therefore propose that either cis or trans interaction of CD47 with SIRPα on cDCs promotes CD4 cDCs survival in secondary lymphoid organs by inducing the tyrosine phosphorylation of SIRPα.
