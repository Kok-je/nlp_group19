The Role of Ocular Perfusion Pressure in Glaucoma Cannot Be Studied With Multivariable Regression Analysis Applied to Surrogates
Ocular perfusion pressure (OPP) is not easily directly measurable, and the difference between blood pressure and intraocular pressure (IOP) has been suggested as a simple surrogate of OPP.1 We write in relation to publications in this journal2,3 and elsewhere4 that have reported a significant association between OPP surrogates and glaucoma."

,"They initialize their orthogonal mapping using an adversarial training phase, much like Conneau et al. [2018], and solve the optimization problem with alternating minimization. Our approach differs from theirs: by bootstrapping on the solution of a smaller problem to initialize the mapping, we avoid the need for a neural network initialization that is used in their approach. In addition, our annealing scheme on the entropic regularization leads to smooth convergence, with very little sensitivity to initialization. Concurrently with our work,1 Grave et al. [2018] tackle the problem of unsupervised word embedding alignment with a similar optimization framework as the one proposed by Zhang et al.

,"Selective attrition analyses revealed no significant differences in project site, race, ethnicity, gender, or child problem behavior (Dishion et al. 2008). Models were tested inMplus 5.21 (Muthén andMuthén 2009) with a full information maximum likelihood (FIML) approach. Although there was some missing data at the two time points (n=651–731 for parent reported measures, n=559–693 for observed variables, including speech samples), FIML accommodates missing data and provides less biased estimates than listwise or pairwise deletion (Schafer and Graham 2002). Using FIML procedures, analyses included all participants except when they were missing data on an independent predictor that cannot be estimated with missingness (e.g., a covariate, such as poverty), resulting in an effective sample size of 728. The use of Mplus also permitted evaluation of multiple indices of model fit including Chi-square, Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), and the significance of individual paths.

We found errors in the hip-joint-centre location of up to 2.01 cm for the scaled-generic model, which is similar to the 2.09 proximal shift of the hip-jointcentre location reported by Lenaerts et al.
