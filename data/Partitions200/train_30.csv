1 Introduction,"In Section 2, we present an experiment by Abeler et al. (2010) that analyzes the relative importance of two conflicting fairness principles—wage equality and horizontal equity. In particular, Abeler et al. study whether equal wages are considered fair and look at potentially detrimental consequences of equal wages on performance. In Section 3, we turn to a second question that becomes important when principals interact with more than one agent, namely, whether the principal can observe agents’ individual performance or only the outcomes of the group of agents as a whole. We present a recent study by Kleine and Kube (2010) that addresses the question whether reporting (subjective) performance measures can enhance the efficiency of interaction in work groups. Next, we discuss a study by Schneider and Kube (2006) that analyzes how differences in social proximity affect gift exchange in multi-worker firms."

"Gastroenterology Department, Centro Hospitalar S√£o Jo√£o, Porto, Portugal","Moreover, this idea is supported by a recently published meta-analysis that analyzed 11 studies and depicted that long-term and well-described short-term outcomes suggest that colonic stenting as a bridge to surgery could be a promising alternative strategy for patients with MLBO.16
 Meanwhile, a Danish nationwide cohort study reported a higher 5-year recurrence risk in the SEMS group (39% vs. 30%), but with similar 5-year overall survival rate.17 Whether the increased recurrence risk of patients with colonic stenting compared to those that performed primary surgery is a result of perforation or other prognostic factors, it is still unknown."
