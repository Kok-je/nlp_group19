,"For example, Kawato et al. (1990) suggested that movement trajectories can be projected using critical via-points through which the trajectory has to pass at a certain time, rather than in terms of the moment-by-moment dynamics of the implemented movement trajectory. Optimal trajectories can then be learnt by applying local optimising principles for getting from one via-point to the next. In this way, impoverished predictions can be used to monitor rich implementations. In the same way, language users might predict particularly crucial aspects of an utterance, but the aspects that they predict will depend on the circumstances. More generally, Meyer & Hagoort question the value of predicting one’s own utterance. They argue that prediction is useful when it is likely to differ from the actual event. This is the case when predicting another person’s behaviour or when the result of one’s action is uncertain (e.g., moving in a strong wind). But they argue that people are confident about their own speech. Meyer & Hagoort admit that they will tend to be less confident in dialogue, and we agree. But more important, we argue that the behaviour of the production implementer is not fully determined by the production command, because the complex processes involved in production are subject to internal (“neural”) noise or priming (i.e., influences that may not be a result of the production command). Assuming that these sources of noise do not necessarily affect forward modelling as well, predicted speech may differ from actual speech. In addition, prediction is useful even if the behaviour is fully predictable, because it allows the actor to plan future behaviour on the basis of the prediction. In fact, we made such a proposal in relation to the order of heavy and light phrases (see sect. 3.1, target article). Hartsuiker claims that our account incorrectly predicts an early competitor effect in Huettig and Hartsuiker (2010). His claim is based on the assumption that Response/Pickering & Garrod: An integrated theory of language production and comprehension"

4. Discussion,"Synaptic heterogeneity is not the only evidence for plasticity of several synaptic parameters: (1) Hebbian pairing of pre and postsynaptic neurons was shown to result in a selective increase in low frequency synaptic transmission (Markram and Tsodyks, 1996) which is due to a specific change in U (Tsodyks and Markram, 1997); (2) while presynaptic regulation of neurotransmitter release is typically considered as a mechanism to block or enhance transmission between neurons, this action rather serves to change the frequency dependence of transmission; (3) paired pulse experiments that demonstrated changes in paired pulse ratios rather demonstrated changes in frequency dependence; (4) we have recently found that an initial stage of LTDa is preceded by a selective loss of facilitation (LTDf) (A."
