Introduction,"However, how frataxin interacts with the Fe-S cluster biosynthesis components remains unclear as direct one-to-one interactions with each component were reported (IscS [12,22], IscU/Isu1 [6,11,16] or ISD11/Isd11 [14,15]).",1872080baa7d30ec8fb87be9a65358cd3a7fb649>894be9b4ea46a5c422e81ef3c241072d4c73fdc0_11,background,"The citation provides context, references prior work, or summarizes existing knowledge.",no_response,Missing <response> tag.
Novel Quantitative Trait Loci for Seminal Root Traits in Barley,"In the study by Hickey et al. (2012), spikes were sampled from the field at the point of physiological robinson et al.: genomic regions influencing root traits in barley 11 of 13 maturity, dried, grain threshed by hand, and stored at −20C to preserve grain dormancy before germination testing.",ce1d09a4a3a8d7fd3405b9328f65f00c952cf64b>b6642e19efb8db5623b3cc4eef1c5822a6151107_2,background,"The citation does not explicitly describe methods or results, likely providing general context.",no_response,Missing <response> tag.
Introduction,"The drug also reduces catecholamine secretion, thereby reducing stress and leading to a modest (10-20%) reduction in heart rate and blood pressure, which may be particularly beneficial in patients with cardiovascular disease.(7) Unlike midazolam, dexmedetomidine does not affect the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide.",9cdf605beb1aa1078f235c4332b3024daa8b31dc>4e6a17fb8d7a3cada601d942e22eb5da6d01adbd_0,background,"The citation does not explicitly describe methods or results, likely providing general context.",no_response,Missing <response> tag.
Discussion,"By clustering with lowly aggressive close kin (King 1989a,b; Viblanc et al. 2010; Arnaud, Dobson & Murie 2012), breeding females may decrease the time/energy cost of maintaining territorial boundaries (Festa-Bianchet & Boag 1982; Murie & Harris 1988), which could ultimately lead to increases in net energy income (TA) or higher allocations in somatic or reproductive functions.",d9f3207db0c79a3b154f3875c9760cc6b056904b>2cc6ff899bf17666ad35893524a4d61624555ed7_3,background,"The citation does not explicitly describe methods or results, likely providing general context.",no_response,Missing <response> tag.
